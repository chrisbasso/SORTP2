United States;PLEASE GO BACK TO CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER ON THE TIMELINE!
Australia;Highly recommend
Singapore;After many times I have tried, there still having the same problem, after multiple photo has been selected the app totally has no response..
Australia;Love the filters, hate the non-chronological feed!!
United Kingdom;You can't even call this an app, it's the biggest load of sh*te ever and a waste of storage on my phone!!!  Why do we need messenger and Facebook, put them back together please!!!  The latest update is pathetic, it's showing me notifications but when I click on them it shows me nothing, sort of out FB ffs, a big company with a SHAMEFUL app!!! Not good enough!!!\nIf I could give zero stars I would!!!
Canada;My news feed shows only stuff from 4 days ago. I see maybe 1 new post to 20 from 4 days ago. Stop messing up a good app
South Africa;You should be able to move your feed around
Australia;Facebook keeps changing things around on it. They should have a few more icon pictures when liking people's posts but overall it's great
Singapore;Wahahahahaha
United States;I love instagram period
Australia;I was banned for 3 months for calling someone a clown
India;Amazing experience..!!
United States;Wrote previously how it was easy to use and begin a new routine. Still true over a month now. I eat out, don't disrupt my family members' lives and continue to stay on track. Now I'm also appreciating recipes and tips. Really is the best tool for leaving denial behind and going forward!
Canada;I have to keep deleting this app since over time it begins to take up more and more space in my phone. It has used 800mb plus, and there is no way it seems to clear this without deleting and reinstalling each time. Very frustrating.
United States;Works great
United Kingdom;I have lost a lot of weight with the encouragement it gives me. When it states I haven't consumed enough would be nice to see more info. Keep up the good work and thank you.
Australia;Go
Hong Kong;Backup D
Australia;Sick of being spammed by ads.. I can't browse without 100's of  ads for apps or products clogging up my feed.. please stop it..\n\nLatest update causing crashing and closing app when I'm exploring then I can't find pins I was looking at.\nAlso doesn't open pages when you try to follow a link ...\n Please fix asap....
India;Superb
Hong Kong;wifi bug can't use
United States;Don't download photos and videos and nothing at all. Change it please!!!!!!
Canada;I think It would be a great idea to add grain to the edit and adjustment section of the app. It will give us a little more variety to as how we would like to edit our photos. Consider it! (:
India;Far better than any other social networking sites ÔøΩ
Australia;No like button. And you can't see the boards of other people who also have the same pin. Prevents you from finding similar boards and pins.   Don't recommend this app.  Used to be a great resource. Not anymore.
Hong Kong;Ôºå iPhone  ,
Canada;I love the thousands of pre populated food options and the ability to insert a full meal into the calorie counter for frequently used meals.
United States;I live instagram don't get me wrong but when ever I try to make another account it says there was an error please try again later or something like that. Then right after it says Instagram doesn't allow blah blah\nReport us if we have made a mistake I waited a week. Is that long enough? Well anyways I can't upload videos for some reason. It gets like half way and then just says retry no one is gonna see this but if someone does please take this into consideration ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Canada;The new Instagram update won't allow me to send any video or pictures to group chats!
Australia;Notifications show and then you have to refresh 2-6 times before they may actually show up! \nAnd - why bother even having a Facebook page for your business anymore when it serves no purpose unless you're prepared to pay a lot of money for ads.
Canada;When trying to upload profile pictures that are good quality pictures they show up blurry and out of focus. Then when you press save it says sorry could not upload at this time try again later but then it does upload and is still low quality. Please fix, it's very annoying.
Hong Kong;Siri
Australia;From the updates I can no longer share with Facebook. Which is sad.
United States;I used to LOVE Instagram. The new update killed this app for me. The amount of ads is absolutely insane. It's overload and has killed the fun of the app.
Australia;Today I checked my Instagram and found that I have lost 100 followers I don't know why this has happened but I am very upset I love this app and use it everyday but this is not good if you could please fix this it would mean a lot
Hong Kong;CHANGE IT BACK
Canada;Its amazing i love this app
United Kingdom;Best sat nav you could possibly need by far.
Singapore;idk if it's happening to everyone buy everytime i upload mulitple photos, it keeps getting blurry ?!
Australia;I think instagram should make the text bubbles coloured
South Africa;Great app use it daily, especially in traffic management üëçüèø
Hong Kong;page apps
South Africa;With each update the app has more and more glitches. It constantly crashes and realistically becomes a waste of time. Facebook, your social platform is becoming a joke just like your app. The larger updates don't seem to fix your excuse for an app
Hong Kong;It is very inconvenient that the posts are not allowing the posting time to show. My fds all dislike this and think that this problem is causing them miss out some of the posts.\n\nMoreover, about the adding location problem. It is so headachy that I want to add a location while there don't provide an accurate option for me. Why don't just like before that we can type or create any locations??
United States;Saved me at least 2 tickets and who knows how time saved by showing the fastest route or if traffic is bad.  Love where I can have a reminder set for when to leave and arrive by a set time.
Canada;Every time I refresh my profile, the app crashes! Please fix this, it's very inconvenient.
India;No experience
Australia;Don't like the new update, I have an iPhone and for the life of me can not like photos or memes in the comments UNLESS someone has written something WITH said photo or meme...
Australia;Pretty cool
Hong Kong;
South Africa;I don't know what changed in the App but each time I record a voice note for longer than 50seconds, the App crash! Please fix, I've attempted to record my voice note 4 times now! Gave up and just sent a message...
Canada;A lot of improvements, but I wish they kept the like button.
Singapore;I love everything about it :) . But i hope u come up wif sth better ?
Australia;I think it awesome,but I think needs a translator when you get messages with different languages would be appreciated to see what friends send me or anyone else. So I can reply to them.
Hong Kong;fashion and life style and good apps
United Kingdom;I've used whatsapp for about 5 years now & I love it. \nAnd since they've brought out this new whatsapp story feature I love it even more. But I think it would make it just a lil better & more fun to use  if they could add filters for us users to use after we take pics just like Snapchat. Now that would be amazing!!
Canada;This is what happens when management screws up.
United Kingdom;This is my first Fitbit and can honestly say I love it
Australia;About as good as a communist Christmas
United Kingdom;Brilliant for helping advertise your business
United States;I like the idea...getting better all the time.\n\nI love the interface updates with this version!!\n\nWhy'd they take Foursquare integration away? (Safety?)
Canada;I love my fitbit and they app makes it so much more\nGreat job
United States;Good
United Kingdom;I love sharing photos
Singapore;Currently settings only allow to set both preview for lock screen and notifications bar at the same time. Preview message should be flexible to set to only to preview on notifications bar instead of lock screen as well.
Australia;WHY am I seeing things on my newsfeed from people who I am not friends with, have no mutual friends with, and have never heard of in my life? It's telling me that so-and-so is commenting on/liking their own or someone else's post who I also don't know - I don't want to see this! Facebook is already filled with so much useless *#$@. The majority of my newsfeed is just filled up with people liking things from spammy pages - nobody posts anything anymore. There's probably a good reason for that.\n\nAnd what have you done with the setting to see most recent news instead of top stories?! Sick of seeing things from literally a week ago. Useless app
Canada;It kept popping up asking me to rate
Singapore;Super lousy FB for anyhow locked my account and request for photo for verification and then no response. And best no customer service to help fix the problem. Only some q n a that are totally not helpful!
Singapore;Couldn't see the list of trackers while doing the initial setting up. Pls do something abt it.
Australia;INSTAGRAM NEEDS TO GO BACK TO CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!!! IM SICK OF LOOKIN LIKE A STALKER LIKER A POST FROM 5 DAYS AGO!!!
Hong Kong;WhatsApp
India;It nice apps but glti sy koi pic send ho jaa hai or vaps delete krni hai dono side sy to nhi ho rhi hai so..!
Singapore;100% best road companion. Waze will be perfect if it can also indicate the lanes to take. That could eliminate a lot of last min turnings.
Australia;I am enjoying using this app and it clearly makes me more conscious of what I eat and drink. Also happy with the link to my Fitbit.
India;Very sluggish app even on iPhone 7, just learn from your owned app Instagram.
Singapore;I Can't Open My Albums Now\n\nThe Cursor Keeps Going Round & Round\n\nIt Happened Since Yesterday - Saturday 3rd June Till Today 4th June.\n\nI Have Been Trying For 2 Days
India;Badly crashing
Australia;I like it. Pretty good.
Australia;Really love my Fitbit app. Easy to use, easy to set up. Excellent features and compatibility with other apps.\n\nHowever - would like to see compatibility with a cycle tracking app for women
United States;Only reason I'm giving Insta 4 stars vs 5 is because they copied Snapchats entire existence. Shame.
Hong Kong;1) Post \n2) tag ' post' Ôºå Ôºå 1 post ' ' \n\n !  ! !
United States;Love love love Pinterest.
South Africa;Don't like the new version at all. Can't see who pinned it.
United Kingdom;I love this app, I lost about 3 pounds in 2 weeks by the intake of 1500 calories and exercise per day. I love the barcode scanner and how Accurate the app is, definitely recommended to everyone! Amazing
United Kingdom;I run a business page for which the main bulk of my business is live feeds. Last night I had to restart 10 times due to Facebook either kicking me or my viewers off constantly. After 4 hours of nothing but problems from 3 devices and wifi and data I had to give up and let my customers down, you're now delaying me opening their oysters and sending out orders which in turn leaves my business looking unreliable. Not happy at all! How do I run a business like this??
Singapore;Internationally reliable maps and gps
United States;Way to go Pinterest, making another terrible update. Who thought removing the info of who pinned what pin on my feed was a good idea? I know! Your advertising department! Just another way you can push more ads without telling your user. I will be looking into alternative apps that don't shove advertising down users throats like you.
Hong Kong;ÔºÅ ‚ãØ‚ãØÔøΩ
Singapore;chronological order PLEASE. Jesus.
Australia;So I just made an account but whenever I reopen the app it keeps coming back to the screen of recommended friends and won't let me change out of it could you please fix this soon
Hong Kong;Why one contact no.  is used in different devices at the same time. Why no recall messages feature. Perhaps, it is added multiple account or contact instead.\nP.S.: I don't think WhatsApp's staffs will read and improve those comments. Usually, they ignore.
Singapore;Like other users, encountering newsfeed images not loading properly recently
India;best app bt provide some more 3d touch features
Canada;Every damn time i send a picture to a group, my entire instagram crashes! When I open it, it goes straight to my home screen so I have to always delete it and reinstall every damn time! Please fix this!
Canada;Instagram was muuuuucccchhh better when my feed was in chronological order. I find it difficult to keep up with people when I don't see half of the posts. Please switch back to chronological
India;Cant see who sent requests or accepted it. Poor step in app!
Singapore;The latest filter kept blinking. Cannot detect my face.
United Kingdom;Love it!
India;I enjoy the service
Canada;Very helpful & informative.
United States;Never misses by more than 2 minutes. You could set your watch by it!
Hong Kong;post
United States;Which doesn't seem to be very often lately. When waze does work it is awesome, it gives live traffic updates and locations of road closures and police, all reported by other users. But it only does this when it can connect to the network. More often than not waze says Searching for Network in red at the top of the screen and all of the stuff that makes waze better doesn't work. This happens to me all time, even with full bars of 4G. There is no point to using waze if it doesn't work.
Singapore;o0o
Hong Kong;What's wrong with the app???\nIsn't the IT team actually wants us delete the app and start using other social media apps??
United States;Great app for getting around LA on sidestreets.
Australia;Love seeing all the images
United States;None of the videos have sound/music anymore :(  PLEASE FIX!!!
Hong Kong;
Australia;Stop refreshing the page every freaking time I open the app!! I am in the middle of writing a comment, switch to another app to check something for 5 seconds, come back and you deleted my entire comment and take me to the home page!! You are destroying this app. Not using it again until you fix this epidemic
United Kingdom;Top
United States;When posting multiple pictures in 1 post, why do all of the pictures have to be in Square mode??! I want to be able to see full pictures. Please change that. Thanks
Hong Kong;I can't share any post to Facebook!!!! I have checked all my settings are all right, but all my post on Instagram can't show on my Facebook wall, PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!!! üò§üò†üò°üí¢
Hong Kong;I wonder if the search history function has gone. If so, I do hope you can bring it back for the next version (well, the sooner the better). That would be a lot more convenient to trace past messages with keywords! Thank you :)
Canada;I gave this app 5 stars because of its features
India;Very nice n love new features
United States;Well it won't let me post statuses or in any groups have to open an shut and it is so annoying !! Last update is crap , closes out and have to start over too !!! Frustrated !!!
Canada;Gets me to my destination no matter the traffic!
Hong Kong;Ôºü
South Africa;The app is amazing but for some reason me, and a lot of the people I live with, are having issues with the app (only today though), it won't allow us to send or receive messages, just letting you know (:
United States;My Facebook keeps freezing. And it's happening about 5-10 times a day. I have to quit the app and reopen it to get it in frozen. I have been keep the app up to date and just got a new phone and it still happening. It is quite annoying. \nAnd my feed is a day behind have the time. \nJust Frustrating!
South Africa;I updated to new version for ios it kick me out when i go in it cant even view anything fix this ASAP
India;Plz solve the problem of story
Singapore;I can't even load or even read and send message out . Why is all this unnecessary updates going on ? Isn't the last update better ? It's getting slower and also worst . I could not even reply and send message . How should I even suppose to do .
United States;- No self-destruct messages.\n- Can't save more than 5 photos/videos at once to Camera Roll.\n- Can't disable group/voice read receipts.\n- App freezes/stutters while downloading lots of media.\n- Video being played is interrupted once a background download finishes. VERY ANNOYING!!\n- Even after clearing up all chats, app still keeps lots of undeletable stuck data.\n- Can't clear all media and keep only text chats (no granular clear all chats).\n- No iPad / Apple Watch / iMessage support.\n- Can't backup only text to iCloud (no granular backup).\n- Swipe for media gallery shortcut removed.\n- Archived messages confusing implementation.\n- No background send from other apps (have to wait for the progress bar to complete).\n- Can't search inside individual chats.\n- Confusing all starred chats UI inside settings: make it like a regular group so we can have all the group features (mass share/save/select-
Hong Kong;I can't upload photos after the new update version!Please fix it!!!
India;The insta story clarity can be made better ..
Canada;Bien pratique !
Singapore;It may be convenient to reply to a message without access code, but it raises another security concern that anyone can reply messages without the consent of phone/ account owner. Hope Whatsapp builder can look into this security concern prudently.:)
Singapore;Hope more stable
India;I find the app quite user friendly and intuitive. I continue to face some niggles such as being unable to tag some of my closest friends, for which I am yet to find a solution. Would appreciate some support from Facebook to solve this issue.
India;The dm is glitchy and texts don't get sent plz resolve the problems\nSuch a famous social media and works like shitt plz resolve the problem
Hong Kong;up
Canada;Can't use my Pinterest on my iPad.  It just blinks and says cannot authorize.....fix it please
United Kingdom;Rubbish, says I have notifications but won't show me what they are.
United Kingdom;It's all you will ever need to get from A to B and back again. Stop reading this and download.
South Africa;Its okay ÔøΩ
India;Multiple photos must be updated to at least  20 photos at a time which will help me and other photographers to post their photo albums more easily
India;Loving it. Connecting with friends and family and other peoples !!
United Kingdom;Great navigation, correct every time.
United Kingdom;Great app
United Kingdom;Good but needs improving as gets a little boring
Hong Kong;iTunesStore Ôºå Ôºå
India;Very very very useful
Australia;Too many updates that aren't really helpful and now every few videos I watch completely freezes my phone to the point I can't do anything to get out of the app besides a hard reset. Please fix bugs before adding features.
Australia;Have been using Instagram for some years now. I have not had any problems with it. Always found it very easy to use and great fun. Easy to load pictures etc. It's a great app.
India;I am unable to share pic(s) from my photo gallery to any group or individual. This is happening right after updating to the current version. \nNot sure if this is only with my device.
United Kingdom;Decided to invest in some tech to help me achieve my healthier lifestyle choice goals following a heart attack. Went for Fitbit charge 2. Early days but experience so far:\n1. Easy to set up\n2. Easy to customise and makes you think about your goals with simple questions to establish a target\n3. Easy to read and well laid out dashboard, which is some achievement given volume of data.\n4. Some interesting tips and video links to help sustain motivation\n\nSo far, so good. Looks good as well.
Singapore;awsome apps
United States;5712497221
India;Stop updating it every week. Everything works well on my iPhone 7 plus except this app. Slowest app. Every now and then it keeps saying network error. The videos never load. I don't understand what's wrong with facebook. Please do something.
South Africa;A great app with lots of wonderful ideas and inspiration
United States;Impossible to turn off! It uses the gps even when not using the app. \nWith location services you have only two choices...always or never! What happened to  when using app?
United States;After latest update keep getting 1 badge icon notification but no messages or likes are present when I open the app.
Canada;The photo collage maker is helpful for me to use
Canada;Please allow me to see every post in chronological order and reduce the amount of ads. It's ridiculous and off-putting.
Australia;Very good app
South Africa;Highly recommended, really helps you get past bad traffic and find your way around. Definite worthwhile program!
Singapore;It says that I have too many accounts registered in my device.. but I only have two of them???
Hong Kong;Cannot check the followers
Australia;A Brain force phenomenon...but you already know that...probably ÔøΩ
India;Alright.
United States;Not sure what happened but my newsfeed will not load!
United States;We these updates I still don't like that I can't see the saved to other boards feature. That one really helped discover others boards and ideas easier. I used to like this app, no it's become something less than it's former self
United Kingdom;Every time I open a paged I have liked it crashes. Been like this for 6months now and after several updates it's still not been fixed!
United States;They kicked me out despite me showing them I'm 13 and I can't talk to a real person
United States;Really enjoy the alerts. \nWill it ever work with Apple Watch?\n\nI really enjoy Maps better. Alerts you with sufficient time to change Lanes unlike Waze. Also displays turn by turn on iWatch so you don't have to take your eyes off the road.
Canada;Small bug fixes please update. Love Instagram ÔøΩ
Hong Kong;Iphone6plus.  „ÄÇ „ÄÇ
India;Good
Hong Kong;How come some sticker could not be use on iPhone 7 but appears on iphone7 plus in stories.
United Kingdom;Few apps seem to get worse, giant updates for unknown reasons, unclear what changes are, no visible improvement for user experience, continues to separate messaging and the main app for no real reason (especially dumb if you also have Facebook-owned Whatsapp). Time to delete forever?
Hong Kong;Can't post video!!!!!!!!!!!
Hong Kong;Cannot upload video
Canada;Can't play any video on my news feed, or otherwise. This app constantly breaks and I was considering giving up on Facebook altogether because of it, since you made it impossible to use Facebook on safari instead of these apps. However, I don't have the option to delete my account. I have forgotten my password on Facebook but remained logged in on the app. I don't have access to the email it tells me to get a code from and it doesn't give me any other option to deactivate or even change my password. I don't want my account up anymore, please fix the bugs instead of doing a new update every day to clear the bad reviews. Please let me delete my account.
India;The new algorithm is pathetic. Earlier the TL was time based. Now it's god knows what based. The reach of the post has been limited so that people are forced to promote their post. Facebook has started to ruin Instagram!!
Hong Kong;wifi  100MB     100MB  wifi
Hong Kong;When I choose 10 photo to upload on Instagram which happen unexpected quit. No matter how many time I have been try it still not working. \n\nPlease fix it.
United Kingdom;Excellent fitness watch and app
India;Instagram with the updated features (story,live etc) is awesome!! Loving it more than Facebook!! ‚ò∫üôÇüôÇ‚úåüèº
Singapore;Very modern Design can be found here.good App to be use.Strongly support for this app
Australia;Excellent app. Easy to use. Excellent links to support and workouts.
India;Requiring too much data and network speed for content loading and for videos playing
Singapore;Help me whatsapp my whatsapp disappeared on my iphone (¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂‡ΩºœÅ‡ºé‡∫∂‡Ωº`)
Canada;J'adore cette apps
South Africa;New status update is the most annoying thing ever. GET. RID. OF. IT.
Canada;I think Instagram is awesome, it's a great way to connect with your friends and show them the cool things that you see and the things that are happening in your life
Hong Kong;Love it
Australia;the day the app reach 500Mb is the day I officially delete it from my idevice
India;Its getting automatically close while browsing chat everytime\nMy imp chat is being missed\nPlease help
Hong Kong;It's sooo annoying..
Hong Kong;1Ôºå Ôºå ÔºÅ
Singapore;Half the time the app just crashes and the other half of the time the app won't work properly but hey it's mark zucc so what can we expect
Australia;Instagram updated last night and now it won't open at all. I even deleted the App & reinstalled with the same result.
Australia;Any chance we'll get a dark theme any time soon? The all white theme kills my eyes at night.
Singapore;Please solve! Unable to refresh newsfeed
United States;Great app, highly suggest
United Kingdom;I'm getting an ad after every 3 posts. Surely this can't be right? I understand you need to make money, but this is just annoying! And there's no way to turn it off!? I'm going to delete the app if this doesn't change, my life is too short to waste it on pointless ads I don't want to see
Australia;Your app freezes when I open it every time. Cannot access ANYTHING
India;Be a group r folder of pics it's good update there should be another update required is send or forward the same group of pics So no need to select all photos again to send some one else.
United States;I am reluctant to spend time writing reviews. However this is hands down the most useful navigation app going.\nGet it?\nGot it.\nGoodüëç
Hong Kong;direct
United Kingdom;That app never let me down. Easy to use. You will not be disappointed
Canada;All my likes are gone!!ÔøΩ
Hong Kong;Not bad~ keep improving~ less weird than before~ ÔøΩ
Australia;So many improvements over time that are appreciated. Thoughtful dev work. Well done!
Hong Kong;post     Ôºü
Canada;Depuis une quinzaine de jours le Scrabble va mal. Je ne peux pas jouer avec mes amis Facebook, sauf deux. J'ai tout essay√©...je suis tr√®s d√©√ßue car je jouais tr√®s tr√®s souvent.\nPouvez-vous faire quelque chose? Merci!
Singapore;Can update to new version of follower and following to lastest follower/following at the top of the list for easy find
India;Sending photos in DM have become near to impossible as the photos automatically changes and the last sent photo replaces the most recently sent photo automatically and photo selection is also not working properly...and notification sound is something that is common with almost everyone on this version of the app.
Singapore;Hate the new algorithm
Australia;I love the new update but the problem is that there is a tiny bug. Every time i either follow or unfollow someone, the app freezes for about 2 seconds. This is very minor but it is very annoying if I'm either following or unfollowing a lot of people at the same time. Please fix this.
India;Add music share option to iphone version
United States;Facebook likes to suppress the freedom of speech also called the first amendment!!!!
United States;üêº‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüêΩÔøΩ

Hong Kong;Story ÔºÅ
Singapore;Whats app contact list is gone and it's not back yet even aft few updates. Pls do something about it! It's really not CONVENIENT AT ALL ÔøΩ
Canada;I can track everything so easily!! Very impressed.
Canada;The Apple Watch version of the app doesn't work at all, just says request timed out anytime I try to access my feed.
Canada;I've been driving the same route home from work for five years not doing it was a better way faster way to get home thanks to this app
India;After the add of grouping feature of images sent by a person, it's difficult to delete such grouped photos while deleting other single photos in a group chat. Please provide a feature to delete grouped photos
India;Amaze
Canada;I received my Blaze yesterday and I have to admit that it is much better than I was expecting. I find it's accuracy quite surprising and love the option of being able to calculate my water and food Intake through the Fitbit app. I have yet to tryout some of the challenges ....
India;Needs to pause music while playing video on instagram .
Hong Kong;... / ...
Canada;You can find all kinds of great ideas for all kinds of stuff.
Singapore;Hope to have full scale option even when we upload multiple photos, currently it doesn't even apply on all same orientation photos. \nThank you.
Australia;Drafts sometimes just disappear...
India;Please reduce the size of the app
United Kingdom;Takes up too much memory.. it's so annoying cause it's always like u need 100mb to use the app.. like I wanna talk to my friends!! They need to sort out how much memory they use it pisses me off..ÔøΩ
Hong Kong;Very lag
United Kingdom;Bought a week ago but only set up 2 days ago, so not yet had much experience. Struggled a little setting up. Seems ok when using but still getting used to. Find it a bit fiddly attaching the battery charger but that's just inexperience. Need to get to grasps with it, have the Alta HR model including making the battery last. Do find it interesting however to track steps. Would rate as good not yet convinced it's excellent but this rating could change with more familiarity
India;It's the best app I've used by far and my favourite too ‚ù§Ô∏è
Canada;Better now A little bit
Australia;Good for ideas over the extra bits got back to basic
India;Great
Canada;It's a really good app for instalikes none of them work but this one does! It's a great app! I had like4like 100 followers and now I'm growing even faster with this app recomend to people who need followers fast.
Singapore;Real good just that data needed to run is damn high
Singapore;I haven't been able to open my app since the last update.. help!
Hong Kong;
Australia;Used to love using and posting on Instagram \nI liked being able to scroll through in time order \nMost recently posted at the top and continue scrolling\nI hate the new update and don't want to see people posts from 4 days ago first...\n\nAt least give the option of choosing how the feed can be \nI'm sure some people like the layout but I do not and wish I could have post time order back.
South Africa;Great way to connect with people everywhere
Hong Kong;I cant search by name in follower and following column. And please set back the latest follower name at follower column. Thanks
Hong Kong;Loved it. Yet it shd stop having similar functions as snapchat lol
United Kingdom;Always telling me to refresh even tho my wifi good
United Kingdom;I have logged for over 820 days.  This site has helped me to lose weight, maintain the loss and be disciplined in keeping fit.  Before I always struggled to keep going. Now it's a way of life and I feel great!\nNow I am up to 1590 days. Still logging daily and keeping in shape.  It's so easy!
Singapore;Please update map as Keep give Long travel distance
India;So I am a food blogger with over 10,000 followers. According to the 'impressions' feature that Instagram has, my picture is just being shown to a 1000 followers. Despite complaining several times I am yet to receive a response. Seems like they don't think customer service is important.
South Africa;Iv'e tried to update for serveral months but need to change my Apple id everytime because when I want to update my id is disabled. I am turning into a Update monster. Nothing on your Webside will fix the problem. Will Whatsapp stop working! No stars!
Australia;I keep getting a notification that I can't like photos. It says my profile contains a link that isn't supported. Can you please fix this !!
Australia;Been great speaking to my dad in New Zealand I can't normally call often cause cause costs so much. Thanks
Singapore;I don't see any FB stories on my timeline....

Hong Kong;Ôºå
Singapore;New updates, fail to receive msg notifications.. pls fixed it.
Hong Kong;ÔøΩ

Allows live video from events which helps publicise things you never would have known existed ., easy to install easy to use . What are you waiting for don't waist precious time get it on your phone .
Singapore;Press and hold to quote messages to reply a particular message in conversation is difficult. Unable to get it most of the time. \n\nComparing to andriod, the message that user wish to quote will get highlighted and makes quoting easier. Can whatsapp look into this? Thks..
Canada;Love it
Canada;Since the newest update, my phone will go from 90% to 5% just trying to load the newsfeed. It crashed three times while trying to upload photos.
Canada;Keeps crashing.
Hong Kong;Why do all the stickers disappear? AND WHY CANT I USE THIS APP WHILE USING MY MOBILE DATA?(I've checked and I've allowed to use my mobile data for this app. I've tried to restart my phone for millions times and it doesn't work at all)
United States;Very reliable
India;Awesome
United States;I have had an issue with my suggested videos disappearing from under my current playing video. I reported the problem to Facebook and then did not contact me in anyway ever stating that they received my issue
United States;I don't think some reviewers understand that Wave's strength is based on it's members reporting traffic.  If you are trying to use it in a rural area or small town it doesn't work well because there are few wazers on the road.  I use it every day in Austin where traffic is notorious.  It is never off by more than 1 or 2 minutes.
Hong Kong;Great
Hong Kong;Can't link with Fitbit, can choose Fitbit Trackers, but still can't access\nI need to give up this app
Hong Kong;~ ~
United States;Amazing!!
United Kingdom;Why can't I tag more people after I've posted anymore?
Hong Kong;Nice
Canada;Keeps crashing every time I try to use the sound.
Australia;Very Entertaining
Canada;WoW Instagram ses super ?t m√™me quand ta pas le r√©seau tu √† droit √† ta page d'accueil
Canada;I am being inundated with ads on Pinterest iPad app.  Many if which show partial nudity.  I am constantly hiding ads that I feel are inappropriate, but more ads appear the next time.  I won't let my kids browse Pinterest anymore, as I could be looking st cupcake recipes when suddenly swimsuit ads or panties ads appear.  No thanks.
United States;I now see an ad ever third picture, this is nuts. I think I would see less advertisement reading a magazine, could we limit them somehow please.
United Kingdom;All you need for quick and safe :) driving
Hong Kong;So annoying
Singapore;I have two accounts, and the archive option only works on the private one. It does not work on my main account. I have logged out and back in again, deleted and re-downloaded the app, but I'm still facing the same problem.
India;Bloody why do U guys update so many times?! Atleast tell us what the new additions or bug fixes like most other app dev does! Now this time apps broken and won't even open ÔøΩ
Canada;posts aren't in chronological order anymore. fix this. it's annoying.
India;Even after updating I can't see the face filter!! Quite strange
India;Image quality declines after sending
Singapore;Best app ever create!
Canada;notifications aren't working and it's super annoying having friend requests in the notification part holy hell
Singapore;I already update latest vision but Very slow when I check notifications\nEdited by 24/05/2017

Australia;It wont let me login at all? FIX THIS PLEASE
India;Hey whatsapp developer i request you to please provide whatsapp lock through which we can lock the app and dont allow any1 use that
United States;I love insta
Canada;Recent updates have enhanced Instagram.
Australia;Thanks.
United States;This is very useful for keep recipes, ideas for your house, party planning materials,  home decor, and much more. Love it
United Kingdom;Amazing apps, best to promote your business.
Hong Kong;Ôºå
Hong Kong;Ôºå
India;Unable to download photos and videos please solve the issue
India;Hello..! This is good app ever but we request you to put my contact function once again because we not able to find each contact and read thein status.. so please..!
South Africa;Why it takes so too long to update though?
Canada;I love ig but when I try and post photos, it crashes and I never get to post them
India;I just discovered a crash in app. In settings i was trying to change the language as i selected any language it gets crashed. I am using katest version in my iPhone 6 iOS 10.
Singapore;Been using it for years and idm the new changes like no more like button, rearranging the profile page where displays all our boards but one damn thing i wish you had is ZOOM\nLike how instagram can now zoom in on the pics, why cant i just pinch the image and zoom in and out\nPlease make that happen cause smtimes when i try to read and infographic its really hard to see and to save the image just to read it is a hassle and like smtimes when u try to open the link to the image its broken or it just can't load so would be helpful to have zoom
Singapore;Many times I refresh my news feed can't even see anything at all it just show no stories to show you I check my own profile can see my timeline only \nThis new update crate more problem
South Africa;Great app
Australia;Love instgram and the updates never seem to affect me :)) still going to keep posting and communicating with friends
United Kingdom;Innovative excellence
India;No comments.. as they are upto mark..
South Africa;First ever navigation app that's useful. Keep it up and let's be safe on the roads.
Australia;App keeps crashing when I try to view pages. So I tried to uninstall then reinstall. Now I can't download the app at all.
United States;Let me default my timeline to most recent. It was there before, just put it back.
United States;I can't post on my own page! This has been a problem for two weeks now. I keep reporting the problem but it has not been fixed. I have reinstalled and updated the app and tried to updated and restart my phone. Nothing works. Please fix this!!!! FB is pretty much useless for me right now!!!!
United States;Most days I've loved the app. These days I'm not getting my notices. Having to redownload every time I want my notices to know who the frack responds to anything I do.  Not any notices no matter what I do or how I refresh. I've even allowed Facebook to share on my phone and still it won't tell me which posts. Horse.
Australia;I love the app
Australia;Great....love it....and easy to use...still learning but Very Happy!
Singapore;There's a bug
Australia;New version is terrible...
Singapore;I really like it mostly now...
Singapore;Keeps crashing whenever I'm halfway editing my photos / videos to post
Hong Kong;, ,     Ôºü
India;After latest update it hangs up too much.....
Australia;Stupid update I can't tag my friends on videos
South Africa;Best
Canada;Bring archives back
United States;Has a great database of foods the barcode scanner is also effective great way to make healthy choices daily
Canada;Tr√®s Plate quand notre petit Waze est rendu au niveau de l'√©p√©e et que notre bonhomme sur le profil reste un bouclier et ne change pas , m√™me si l'indicateur dit que nous avons d√©pass√© les\npoints......d√©cevant serait appr√©ci√© de r√©soudre le probl√®me \nNathaliespeedy70 ‚òπÔ∏è
Canada;A couple things that are very frustrating: sometimes the app has a mind of its own, and will only show sleep quality for certain nights while mostly every night it shows sleeping stages. It never shows both every night, which I don't understand why. Another thing, I always have to edit my log. I don't understand why the Fitbit doesn't sync the entire night without my help. For the most part, the app does what it's suppose to. It needs an update though! There are bugs and issues.
South Africa;My latest version of WhatsApp is freezing and not allowing me to send messages
South Africa;Good stuff
United States;There's no need for this app to know where I am at all times. Creepy. Deleted it due to this requirement.
India;Fantastic app for my favourite pinterest. Thanks
Australia;I still don't have archive feature on instagram.....
Canada;When viewing photos in a post I can't veiw all the photos, just the first ten. Commenting on them is ridiculous, and no friend request button. WTF Facebook SMH
India;While texting to one recipient, message preview from other recipients is not working. I could understand that I received a message only through the number present beside arrow.
Canada;this app doesn't work on my phone and needs to be fixed
Canada;Love love love Instagram! The app is amazing! The only thing is, when I try and post multiple pictures, when I get to the part in the posting process where you write the caption, the app crashes. Please fix!
United Kingdom;It's good to branch out for company's, just be careful what you put up for others to view. You never no who's looking...
India;Kindly provide us with an option to choose whether we want to join a group or no when a new group is created by someone.
Australia;I'm not using any bots. Totally BS that I have to delete the app regularly so I can use Instagram properly. Sort it out ÔøΩ
United Kingdom;‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
India;Whatsapp can never be like snapchat! Therefore stop copying it. After status whatsapp does not looks good. It is used as messaging app.
Hong Kong;I DO NOT WANT TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS!!!!! STOP ASKING ME EVERYTIME I REFRESH.\n\nAnd with every update, I see another effort to bombard my feed and notifications with ads and suggestions. It's getting very frustrating and seems ig never listens. If there's another option to ig, I would jump the boat immediately.
United Kingdom;Simple reliable fast and efficient
Hong Kong;I am sure that I have internet connection. However, it keeps saying that the page cannot be loaded as I do not have connection. I have tried several times already and it is still not working.
Canada;This update needs to do away with the direct option & bring back messenger within Facebook instead of closing down Facebook & opening the messenger app
Canada;The pest for sharing and keeping track of recipes
Singapore;It is awesome but paragraphs spacing and desktop version will be mind blowing!
Canada;How can I stop ads for singles popping up. It's bad enough I get 95% naked girls on my feed, note she thinks I'm looking at singles ads. I realise it's revenue,  but there same ad everytime?
India;This is the best app i have ever used but after update this app is showing ads after 2-3 post and that is irritating to see. Give some option to block that ads
Canada;I have a 12 iPad Pro and in this app the pics look dreadful. What app doesn't have a high def version? I will just use in Safari.
United States;Despite the weekly updates, I cannot read articles without the whole app lagging or forcing me out of Facebook completely. \nNeeds lots of work.
India;Excellent
Hong Kong;Please improve ....
Singapore;Nice app but should bring back the update before where in your followings, it sorted out by who you last followed to who you've been following the longest. I think that was neat. And please make a function available where you get to delete an account  where you forgot your password for. Please
United Kingdom;I'm Not able to see the posts for my notifications
Canada;Only suggestion is don't save posted photos
Hong Kong;
Singapore;?ÔøΩ
South Africa;It knows where you going, how fast, fastest reroute, an hazards like road works or cops.
Singapore;It's been years that I had use Instagram it's really great! But,now I can't because whenever I tried log into my acc it says sorry there was a problem with my request so I can't use Instagram anymore.Please fix this thank you.
India;Looking forward for more feature!!
Canada;Can't live without it!
Canada;The new algorithm sucks. I preferred a more random feed. If I want to see the same 10 people over and over I would use Facebook.
Australia;Instagram helps us a lot!
Hong Kong;Iphone  copy android
Canada;I have just been given my wife's old Fitbit Charge. She has the newer one. Other than the look and the new features of the new one, I think that the old Charge is great! ?
Australia;U can save images to your gallery, and learn how to do stuff!
Australia;My phone sends me notifications and on the icon it tells me I have notifications. But once in the app, no notifications. I have to go searching for things Im following or have been tagged in... I guess this could be the push I needed to delete Facebook.
Canada;I can't get in the app
Singapore;Always very reliable. Best app ever
Canada;Thanks for letting us find our tribe.  Practising holistic communication works well on your platform.  #Love #collagenbabe
India;After the update my instagram is not working . Idk y
India;Why its lagging even on 7 plus ! While scrolling newsfeed any video comes then it lags nd also by swiping right it takes few secs to get swiped. Plzz fix it !
United States;i love instagram dont get me wrong but PLEASE bring back chronological feed and can we stop with an ad every 4 pictures? this is why i dont see my friends post until 3 days later and at that point i look like im stalking. Also can someone get rid of the porn accounts??? i get at least 10 accounts with profile pics of a naked girl saying nudes a day its annoying and im 16 i dont need this. Ig i love ya but please get ya life together
South Africa;Awesome application. I'm hooked for life.
Australia;I've always had timeline in time order until today and this algorithm rubbish is just making me see stuff I've already seen and have to scroll and scroll for new content.
Canada;Used to be a great app. Now there are ads every 3 photos. Kills data for irrelevant video ads
India;Simply awesome \nAmazed with level of details and direction
Hong Kong;People use instagram to get famous
India;User friendly
India;Very helpful in a regular life and to improve knowledge & Ideas
Singapore;Very useful on the roads. Cheers
United States;This app is awesome
United Kingdom;The best navigation I've used by far
Hong Kong;apps, ÔºÅ
Singapore;The new update is ridiculous. It is way spamming too much ads.
United Kingdom;Hi there its been always a pleasure to use this app until it just stopped working. I put navigation to always on my settings, on/off the phone all the time but no result. My service provider suggested to write a review and see what you've got to offer. I use iPhone 6 if it matters Many thanks
United States;I JUST got the update and surprise, surprise the app still doesn't work. Social network wise, IG is cool. Their app however is the worst.
United States;The app will not let me upload multiple photos without it freezing or crashing. Been trying to upload photos to my album for the past 2 days and no luck. PLEASE FIX!
Canada;This app is supplier super cool I love it!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
United States;excellent!
Singapore;Unable to search for keywords in chats. Search now only does contacts names and not words in chats! Pls fix it
South Africa;Whatever happened to the like button?\n\nI can spend hours and hours on this app without realizing how long i've been browsing, being inspired, getting ideas. The best thing is that there is everything that one can look for even hairstyles for my afro. When i need a photo of something, i no longer google it rather pin!?????????????\n\nWhat
United States;Dear Mark Zuckerberg, what happened with Facebook being cool, your app is now full of adds. Remove them please
Australia;I could handle it when they took away the option to show most recent first, I mean who wants to see a post from three days ago, seriously? Maybe I have OCD I don't know but I like my stuff in order. \nAnyways easy fix, you just find it in the sidebar. Tap. Off you go. \nUnless you accidentally do the tiniest swipe and you're back to that start but that's another matter. \nBut now they've removed the sidebar and make you stuff around down the bottom til you find the Most Recent icon and reset your whole feed every time you check your notifications. \nNot digging it.
Hong Kong;d  ÔøΩ
United States;Minimal issues. User friendly.
Canada;It's fine.
India;Please introduce dark mode and also feature to lock chats
United Kingdom;I previously gave a review stating that this app had become unreliable. Actually it was the gps sensor in my iPhone which was at fault. So, updated to say this app is great especially the community driven road updates and reliable maps.
Singapore;The app is lag on iPhone 6s Plus.
India;Nothing could be as good as this! Productive app!
United Kingdom;please make a multiple calls pleaseee ??
Australia;A lot of my friends with iPhones have an expanded choice of  background colours unfortunately I don't ÔøΩ
Canada;Great in rush hour to avoid the big tie ups
United Kingdom;On the old school instagram i had no problems at all and everything was running fine but as youve added more and more things it starts having this glitch where im unfollowing people?! Can you please make one big update that fixes all the reported bugs please!
United States;Great app. Gets better. Need more accurate routes
United States;Awesome
Singapore;THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM! I can't see some of my contact's Profile Pic. I can see it on my friend's phone but no image on my phone. Why?
South Africa;My go-to app to share images taken on my journey through life. Instagram stories is a great tool to show people what I'm up to. I love the explore section and the collections feature is a great way to save and curate the content that I like on thhe platform.
Canada;Best route app!!
United Kingdom;Szybki update, czytelna, bardzo pomocna i bardziej aktualna od navi np z Google czy Apple
Singapore;Simple to use... and accurate too
Australia;Great way finding. Updates to keep up with traffic and usually finds the fastest way between A and B as long as you don't mind using a lot of backstreets. It doesn't always avoid all delays (eg, train crossing wasn't working and had to wait for 20 minutes instead of retorting) so that's why it's only 4 instead of 5.
Australia;Hi so I love your app because it is like a magica path to wonder and helps it is just tremendous
Australia;I've always loved this app and still love its purpose but it's userbility after the latest update is driving me insane!!! It's riddled with bugs. I have to add my phone number, create my username and update the settings almost every time I log in. NOOOO I do not want the pics saved to my camera roll!!!! I think I'll have to delete the app. I can't take it anymore
United Kingdom;I love this app because I can talk to my friends and family ?
United States;Keeps good tract of my calories and exercise - also lets me what I will weigh down the road
Canada;I really loved this app.
India;Good app
India;I'm not able to log in into my account after the new update! It was working fine until I updated the app! Whenever I try to log in, it shows that there's a problem with your request! Can you guys please fix this?
Singapore;how come nowadays my newsfeed keep showing stuffs and news that are few days ago instead of the latest one ?! it's quite annoying..
India;Yes awesome... But some time phone hang... What the reason ... Don't know...some time blocking for friendship request is not justify...
Singapore;every time i try to scroll through a page in facebook the app crashes!!!!!
South Africa;So sad. If I open the app, it closes itself after 30 seconds. ? do i can't use my fitbit
United States;I love the new changes. It makes it easier to tag someone and edit.
United States;Driver friendly that beats other navigation programs. Love it.
United Kingdom;Really helpful hints and ideas. Thanks!
Australia;Love it
United Kingdom;Well I'm not the sort to write a review, but, I'll tell you what, I love myself some instagram, hands down my favourite social media app ever !! 4 ever !!
Singapore;Why emoji cannot at the center of my message. I read all the groups they sending emoji can at the center.
United Kingdom;Amazing improvement on this app since I first downloaded it years back. Great alternative to Skype & FaceTime. Very convenient all in one communication tool. Great stuff
India;Vry gd app
Australia;It asked me to rate it so I'm rating itÔøΩ
Hong Kong;Can't use after updated!
Hong Kong;PostÔºå PostÔºåDebug App
Canada;Easy to use and reliable. The pothole and police alerts are great!
Singapore;Recent after update.  I keep have no notification only when I on the apps. Then all the message come.  Please revert on this. \n\nNot sure is bug issue or.   I have friend having the same issue.
Canada;Good support system for my health
United States;Down 3 pounds after using this app for one week. Love how easy it is to use and how it helps to keep me accountable for what I put in my mouth.
Canada;I just love opening IG and seeing the exact same posts I saw 8 hours ago. ? Everyone misses the chronological timeline, so please bring it back.
South Africa;Love it and everything about it. Please allow us to at least save our own pics!
Hong Kong;When I go to public pages, the app is closed and go back to iPhone main page. I can only see the page with Safari instead of Facebook app. It happened couple of months. Please fix it ASAP
Canada;I'm at almost a gig on this phone for this stupid app. It doesn't even say what it's updating just updates every couple weeks. I've got better things to use my space for
Australia;PLEASE STOP THE VIDEOS FROM AUTO-PLAYING !  \n\nIt's very off-putting (I find) - to be looking through the items, and videos are playing all over the place.\n\nAnd anyone else who feels the same- please copy and paste this message \n\n‚ù§Ô∏èLove the app apart from that
Singapore;Very useful for communication especially old friends or family members. But most of people are use for religious and political, that things I don't like it. Whatever, it's most of the best social media ever
South Africa;So very useful! I waited too long to get this app and now I'm hooked!
Hong Kong;I STILL CANNOT GET THE WEEKDAY STICKERS !! Can you fix this bugs ???
India;There's a problem with the update dated 16 may 2017 please fix it's loading too much
Canada;I like many of the ideas and functionality of Pinterest. My complaint is that they don't have a clear way of saying show less of a certain type of image.
Canada;How come I'm not getting sound on any of the videos anymore? :/
Australia;I wonder can u add use voice to report things? Cuz type by hand when driving is so dangerous
India;Nice app
Hong Kong;Ig story  day of the week  „ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ
Canada;good good !
Hong Kong;Great app to share your life with others!!!
United Kingdom;Don't like the loss of the Messenger icon from the Facebook screen. Screen freezes in the middle of a post. This is not an improvement.
Australia;Makes sharing photos really easy. You can use filters and add captions to your photos.
South Africa;Waze is a super initiative! It really helps you in traffic and for that you also need to thank all your participating Wazers! With Waze I don't need another Gps, the navigation is really very good! For that I thank the Wazer Team! I use Waze every day either for assistance for myself or to make life easier for my fellow Wazers! Thank you for the initiative & all the hard work in the background!
Hong Kong;Too much advertising
Canada;Excellent App...one can find the calorie count on any food. Very pleased with theApp.
United States;It's the best app for traffic.  Ty
Hong Kong;It make the Facebook app so slow.
Canada;Facebook is awesome but I can't get in
Australia;It‚Äôs an awesome app, as it is easy to use, help you get a real followers, to be smart, elegant and different to  use this app. To change your social media life. Works wonderfully! They deliver the insta likes fast and you can complete offers to get more
Australia;Great app but would prefer my stream to be kept chronological and less ads. Stories is bull.
United Kingdom;Awesome app really. Nothing to say
Singapore;It froze and won't update. What's wrong?
United States;Until we have the option to use the location services on this app set to while in use, I'll leave it uninstalled. It's ridiculous to have this apps location services set to always
United Kingdom;Pinterest is great for searching for ideas you know you want to look at but the feed page of pins from whom you follow is just awful these days. It rarely shows me anything I want to see and it has removed the caption underneath pins to say who pinned it. Devs: bring that feature back asap! If you can keep it for promoted pins (i.e. sh*t I don't want to see) you can keep it for the pinners I do want to see.
United Kingdom;Really good app to share funny and fun things
United Kingdom;There have been a lot of changes lately that have made me no longer really use the app. My feed no longer shows who has pinned what. There are too many ads. And to top it off you got rid of the ‚ù§ option, which means you also got rid of the liked section where I had loads of pins waiting until I had the time to put them in boards. Sad to say I don't like the app any more and will be deleting it if things don't improve ‚òπÔ∏è
United Kingdom;Jesus Christ is the only Way, Truth and Life ?
Australia;Older version is way better, this app keep crashing each time I open it!..\n\nThis app keep getting worse from each update!
Hong Kong;hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Canada;EVERYTIME I TRY SENDING AN IMAGE ON DMS IT CRASHES AND I OPEN IT AGAIN IT CRASHES I ALWAYS HVE TO UNINSTALL THE APP AND INSTALL IT AGAIN BS FIX THIS
United States;Pinterest is my own organized filing cabinet.  Love it!
India;Useless updates
United States;The app automatically updated and now I can't get into my account it only works online for me ??‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it keeps saying Sorry, there was a problem with your request like whaaat tf ?? Ig mad trippin yo.
United States;Easily the best fitness tracker.
United States;Best way to save and organize stuff you like, think is funny, want to go back to, share, etc.
India;features not for older version of iOS. you should have mentioned itÔøΩ
India;i can't able to receive notifications until i open my app?zzz fix the problem soon...!
Australia;Instagram has lost its main focus that made the app great. Stories and albums now? Stop trying to make Instagram something it's not. Also how about an iPad app. This service is getting more annoying than ever.
Canada;Please.
Singapore;What's with the sudden spamming of ads on my newsfeed??? Before I updated it only shows 1-3 per day which is fine, but after the stupid update the ads keep appearing EVERY TIME I REFRESH WTF?!?!? It's so annoying pls fix this.
India;In current version we can only mute the status. Developers please add a option wherein we can block the status of a particular person without blocking his or her contact. Because mute doesn't hide the status.
Australia;Teaching me lots of back routes I would never have found! Fantastic!!!
India;Fix this problem ..\nI don't seen who are seen my status
United States;Will NOT share to Facebook! ÔøΩ
United Kingdom;Have enjoyed this app, but frustrated to share to my Facebook business page. It appears to allow only one admin - we have 3. Therefore my shares go to my personal page which is not what I want. Frustrating ?
United States;Great ?
United Kingdom;Accurate and reliable, also very well designed.
Canada;Love this app, other then it's tendency to direct me to the roads that are empty for a reason. It has directed me to a road that has ended up being closed a couple times and just yesterday directed me to a road that was flooded. Perhaps if there was a way to report to not take that road the way that we report hazards?
South Africa;Best app to get shortest/fastest way to your destination \nThank you
Australia;- terrified customer service \n- blocked tagging from first moment out of no where\n- its been week and no response to messages requesting to fix\n- fan club account unable to tag the main person whats the point \n- insta don't care to look into it or respons
Australia;whats happen Pinterest ??\nyou have lost all my saved pins since updating your app\nhow do i get back the thousands of ideas i have been collecting\nvery disappointed
Canada;Love pin ?ÔøΩ
Australia;Horrible app ! Super hard to navigate! Waste of space
India;Where in the world is the option for hiding an activity from timeline? It only shows unlike or delete it the activity log. Why it's been stripped down? Where are the tabs gone? Replying comments have agaon changed. What is happening?
Hong Kong;good app
Singapore;Although I may not agree to its nonsensical warning of saturated fat every time I eat my favorite roasted pork belly, nevertheless, it's a great app. I can find most of the food's calories and that itself is a good assist which helped me keep an eye on my daily calories intake and attain my ideal weight.
India;No need of such updates. Of 212 MB Twice a week
Canada;It's so fantastic to share photos or videos to friends and it's so simple to use!\n C'est une app fantastic pour montrer des photos ou des vid√©os √† des amis et c'est vraiment simple d'utilisation! ?
South Africa;Awesome
Canada;You guys need to find a different way for ads in videos. Either before the video starts, or add a skip button you completely ruin the experience of watching a video someone has posted by stopping it a few minutes in for an add. As soon as the ad starts I lose interest in finishing the video.
Hong Kong;It said this video could not be sent. Please choose another video\n\nIn fact all videos are not able to send
Canada;I never write reviews but come on Facebook. You keep making making us download a new version and these new versions are shittier and shittier each time. Put the messenger thing back where it was, and take the friend requests out of the notifications. There should be 5 things at the bottom while I'm on Facebook. Not 3 ?
Singapore;Best GPS app user friendly, clean design and clear directions
United Kingdom;I love this app but when you're viewing links the pin it button is covering a lot of the post making it impossible to read! Please fix this!
Canada;Amazing app
Australia;I like my photography and i like sharing my photos on Facebook but every time I try to add some photos into an album I've created the app freezes and doesn't let me upload my photos. Please fix this, it's causing grief for me \n\nAlso, the quality of profile pictures being uploaded is terrible
South Africa;The newest version opens up on my iPhone but even after re-installing Pinterest in my iPad, it doesn't even want to open the app.
Australia;I Absolutly love instagram its my fav source of social media \nA tips to highly consider\n\nTo enable and edit/change the cover frame on an Instagram video once it's already uploaded?
United States;My favorite app. Has everything from food to clothes to crafts and everything in between.
Canada;La version premium vaut la peine. Je trouve √ßa g√©nial !
Hong Kong;Can't show the photo after update
South Africa;One of the messaging apps.
United Kingdom;Doesn't get any better than this! Absolutely fab!!! Never leave reviews but this deserves one! Must have for any journeys. Recommending to everyone!
Canada;Depuis environ deux mois j'ai perdu mes amis √† droite, apr√®s quelques mises √† jours ils ne sont jamais revenus...pouvez-vous m'aidez?
Hong Kong;I want the favourite contact list back!!!
Australia;Each update it's gets worse, the family and close friends tabs never show the people I have selected for these groups. All posts are not put in the news feed. The chat heads are gone on IOS.  can no longer see who is online with out searching for the person in messenger. The shopping option seems to only work for some people and I'm not on the those. And the story at the top... this isn't snap chat or instagram.
Australia;Really good I love it!
United States;Very easy to use and love all the features!  Plus, it's very accurate and reliable.
India;Who made this update? Worst update ever...
South Africa;Although I have an onboard GPS plus various related apps installed on my iPhone and iPad, when I travel and require realtime assistance on what route will get me at my destination on time, WAZE remains my preferred choice. My most reliable, user friendly and up-to-date-to-the-moment travel companion!
Canada;...you Waze!
Canada;Are you kidding me? You don't fill up my explore page with enough advertisements? Oh, not to mention the ones you slip in between stories. Moving to drop Instagram like Facebook.
Australia;Messenger gone, no group search function.
Canada;Love this app. Guides you around traffic with all kinds of amazing tricks and secret routes. Discovered routes in my city I didn't know about! Never drive without it.
Singapore;great but no swift key on apple..can u install?
United States;The boards make it so easy to save the pins by subject. When I need to shop for something, I can get back to one I need to refresh my memory. When I workout I can find the pin that lets me focus on my arms or abs. Great app!
India;Great app. Very useful. Please give apple watch support!!!!!!
United Kingdom;Helps me monitor my calorie intake and exercise
United States;I use it mostly when I am driving by myself so I can't tag a lot of hazards and traffic but I greatly appreciate those who do.  I have used in different cities and in construction and it is always accurate!   Thank you for a great back!
Canada;Cool app!
India;I getting issues in video ! And i hate that please inform and improve your app

Canada;No more button for friend request. Also, you should put an update log
Australia;Been using waze for a while now so happy I found this to replace google maps
Australia;The new update doesn't allow me to search within my followers or following. Please fix this
Hong Kong;Good
United States;Locked me OU tod my account bc my face wasn't totally looking at the camera like some psycho path, seriously? Fb is a joke
Hong Kong;Block √Ø¬º≈∏
Canada;Is there something wrong with facebook or its just my wifi? Because i cant scroll down any further in my news feed
India;Fringerprint security feature must be available in whatsapp
Hong Kong;update app, Ip7 whatsapp icon 3D touch , √Ø¬Ω≈æ
South Africa;My Facebook keeps crashing! It won't even open!!!!!!!!!!! \n Have serious work to do in it, very disappointed !!!!
Australia;Stop changing the look of Facebook! It's actually annoying. I don't like having my friend requests in my notifications and I don't like having my messenger button at the top
Singapore;Please fix it immidiatelly dont support a new vesion..my phone ios 7.
Singapore;this update didnt do anything to me at all. i looked like its even worse than before. i can't upload videos but only pictures. my internet is literally fine but when i want to upload a video, it either says preparing which it didnt even prepare, instead it just loaded half way or no internet when my internet is perfectly fine. instagram, you need to fix this. its pissing off alot of instagram users
India;Alwayz stay tuned to app love it
Canada;Great for setting up boards for ideas. Also love the animal humour stuff
Canada;Update - support replied & said they're aware of this problem (stuck at Baby Wazer) but nothing they can do right now. Give me a break, this has been a problem for 2 years!!!! This is the 3rd time I've given this app a chance. \n \n Finally, someone else in support fixed my account.
Canada;Will not sync to my brand new charge HR... fix happens every update...
Australia;Stupid update. Can't like photos or comments in a thread. Still defaults to popular so it's the same every time I log on. Very boring.
South Africa;Wow! I cannot believe how Pinterest changed\n I love Pinterest and I couldn't complain!!
India;Is there any need for regular update. Can't make a good app, . Better to use web version??
Canada;After being on the app for like 10 mins it closes itself down. My screen goes black and I'm back to my phone background. Please fix this. √Ø¬ø¬Ω
Canada;Nothing will load, nothing is working and not only for me for all my friends too. I think it has something to do with the new update...
Singapore;Very reliable.
Hong Kong;whatsapp √Ø¬º≈í google whatsapp√Ø¬º≈í √£‚Ç¨‚Äö
India;Please decrease the aap size.. why u dont ubderstand the memory issue..countinuously size of the app is increasing..
Singapore;When I went out to different places, the bad point is that I can't save a story until once I reached. This would save amounts of phone data. So I put moderate as it is good to share stories n feelings. Pls update this App which could save pictures or videos from phone gallery before uploading to the Instagram story by adding gallery button in it, thanks.
South Africa;Whatsapp keeps connecting and never connects- all my other apps are working so its not a internet connection problem ????????????????????? Please help
India;Now after new updation, when some1 sends videos and it becomes group , its hang too much too open.. fix it..
South Africa;?√Ø¬ø¬Ω
India;In chat list last row hidden in 7+ iphone
Australia;I can't believe anyone can give this app anymore than 3 stars. Used to be amazing when it was about you, friends and things you would like to follow. Unfortunately with the initial change of not having posts in chronological order completely ruining the experience until the recent update of have advertisements every 3 posts. I would understand them in the explore section but to have them in my feed makes it very hard to keep this app. I wish only that you could go back 6+ months to when it was the best and only app I would use. Hopefully we see some sort of new photo sharing app take your place now!
United States;Great Ideas, Great Variety - Thank You!
India;Blah blah blah
South Africa;A great source for new ideas
India;Awsm to use
Singapore;Instagram started its update with the new logo, which was fine by me. Then it had the multiple accounts feature so I can switch between my accounts easily. However, what really ticks me off is that whenever I tag someone in a post, it will automatically send it as a DM to the person I tag unless I choose otherwise. I often criticize people in comments, and it keeps sending it as a DM. Now it looks like I'm looking for a fight with them.
United States;Instagram is fun and easy to use but its legitimately copying Snapchat. Personally this annoys me and should be stopped. They're both popular apps but having Instagram so desperately try to outdo and copy Snapchat is honestly getting irritating. I've stopped updating the app due to the annoying 'perks' which are exactly what Snapchat has. IG should just stay how it was as a photo sharing app and stop trying to compete. It's better off as something original than a cheap copy.
Singapore;After the update my fb keeps on crashing!!! I can't even watch videos, can't open any page or any groups or else the app itself would crash! Not just that, whenever i updt status, when i type it became so slow + it would move the typing to other sentence!
South Africa;Please make the whatsapp status videos to be 1 minute long
United States;I must say this app with its dynamic info generated by the users has not let me down during why travels. And with every update it gets better
India;Not able to download pics/video/audio over wifi....please look into this.\n with mobile datapack everything is fine.
India;Tewqyij
United States;Easy to use. Very helpful in tracking calorie intake.
Singapore;I updated last night and now the app is crashing. Whenever I open it, it just shows blank screen and goes back to home screen. Tried restarting and switch off my phone a lot of times but nothing happened. Still the same. Need to fix this issue asap. Also re installed, it is still crashing. Please fix asap.
Australia;The app crashes every time I use it. I have to uninstall and reinstall to be able to use it each time. So frustrating
India;What exactly Facebook updates in app? Every now and then I see app updates consuming hundreds of MBs data...\n Disappointing...
United States;I love IG helps with my catering company so much @dezontheforksandspoons follow me √¢¬ù¬§√Ø¬∏¬è
United Kingdom;:3
United States;Good
Hong Kong;√Ø¬º≈í
India;Please Add option for changing fonts. Else it's the best application for social networking and helpful app for sharing photos and videos to family friends.
United Kingdom;Use all the time now.
United States;Good Instagram
South Africa;Mark I get it. You want to buy everything but by doing that and then making them all alike is going to make those apps redundant. Whatsapp is a messaging up. We don't need live updates! Please bring back the contact list.
Hong Kong;The last update has disabled my iPhone's ability to upload photos to Facebook. The app freezes or quits itself. Frustrating
Canada;Good
Singapore;Love the entire app. Awesome!
United Kingdom;Very good app always works well no problems
Canada;Usually always runs smoothly, almost never experience anything bad or too glitchy.
Hong Kong;contact,\n  down grade d!\n \n Poor update !!!\n I can't find my contact ,\n Not user friendly anymore !!!!
Hong Kong;Cannot open the app after latest update, but it is ok now after restart iphone
United States;Love it!!!! Use it every day!!
Australia;It's pretty good. Only exception is the hundreds of megabytes of updates it insists on updating a few times a week without any explanation.
United States;Use it frequently and is the best app out there for my needs.
United States;You have swallowed my soul!
United States;When I hit a wall in terms of creativity this app helps get me focused, showing me suggestions that I would have never thought about
South Africa;Just great ?keep it up
United States;Amazing app. Best part is constant updates by users & the trip planning!
Australia;Once you have determined (from the picture shown) what you would like it is often difficult to get to the actual site or tutorial.
Hong Kong;Tab
Singapore;why did they remove the like feature?? BRING IT BACK
United States;They let these huge accounts post spam ads ALL THE TIME multiple accounts will post the same thing about dumb products that don't exist or are spam and when report them nothing happens. I guess you can say I loved the OLD instagram.
Hong Kong;Too many ad makes me feel sick
United States;I don't like that I searched for something (date is: 6/28/17) and that I can't see which PIN is the most popular/will give me the best results....! The whole reason I PIN is to get ideas/suggestions from those who have engaged in my query before ?.... \n \n Before 6/18/17....\n \n ...Easy to Navigate!\n \n I enjoy using my pinterest app all the time! I use it for recipes and crafts, and when I'm feeling motivated I use it for exercise tips and dream travel destinations. This app is so addictive!
Canada;After uploading videos Instagram distorts my file. Now they seem very muddy. Thanks Instagram for ruining great footage. No point in shooting in 1080p anymore\n \n Also my videos appear to be blurry. Also what up with this new update looks like everyone on instagram very excited about it haha\n \n Too many adds \n way too many fake accounts\n ruined my high quality video files
Hong Kong;IOS10.3.1,\n  WhatsApp √Ø¬º≈í √Ø¬º≈í\n   , send \n  √Ø¬º≈í
United Kingdom;Great app for saving time in london especially at peck times
United Kingdom;Honestly every single update is exactly what Snapchat has. Are you not capable of getting your own ideas?? Stop copying snapchat it's honestly so annoying. I used to like Instagram, now it's my least favourite social media app.
India;Whatsap doesnt support most of the emojis which is send to me from other andriod phones it's going on from past 3-4 months doesn't support new emojis work hard on it.
United Kingdom;I think its too much like Snapchat with the filters but I like it
Singapore;It's good no bugs glitches
United States;excellent
Canada;WAY TOO MANY ADS NOW! Instagram is absolutely awful to use now that there's an ad every 5 photos. Completely wrecks the experience. HATE IT
India;Dear team in my phone whatsapp 3G calling not available so please do something to I use 3G calling in my whatsapp
Canada;Make an update where you can see who you've have a pending follow request with
Australia;Bring back chronological order!
Australia;It keeps crashing since the new update
Singapore;I have updated the app to the latest version. Re-install it as well. Still no face filter on my story. Why is it certain accounts has this error? Appreciate if this error is fixed soon!
Hong Kong;√Ø¬º¬Å\n  √£‚Ç¨¬Ålock
Canada;Future of Facebook is dead it's not young anymore to many of the older generations are useing it Facebook used to be for high school students now it's just plain old.... it can't keep up Facebook is dead sorry to say it but it's true.
Australia;Instagram used to be my favourite social media app, but now there are so many ads in my feed it's impossible to even see my own friends photos- please reduce the number of ads Instagram! They are frustrating and mostly completely irrelevant. I would even be happy to pay for an ad free version- it's that ridiculous.\n \n Also the way notifications are shown in groups now means I am constantly missing comments or likes from friends that I would usually reply to. It was much simpler and easy to see before.
United Kingdom;I have enjoyed working with Myfitnesspal ap and find it help to understand about food and why when trying to diet it can be very hard to stick to a plan thank you.
United States;i will update my app, like any other person, and the update will not actually happen. most people i know have this new archive photos update and i do not. i'm not sure why. I don't know how to get it but i'm missing out.
India;Frequent updates, Lot of app size (which includes data). Rest the app is running smoothly.
Singapore;Contact List GONE! \n Please bring back the contact list soonest
United States;It always tells me there's an error, I really hope you guys can fix that asap .
India;Cant update my profile pic with this version
United Kingdom;I thinkI like4like to use this app to get more followers so that i can promote my instagram account and I recommend this to anyone who wants to get out there as the followers will come as more likes happen ! The best likes app in the world they will allow you t this app is the best one ever all the other one u have to pay and all that stuff but ye,I love it u should get it now It works super
Hong Kong;√Ø¬º≈∏
Hong Kong;Why we cannot select ig video NOT auto playing? So annoying, inconvenient and data concern!
United States;My husband and I have been hiking, jogging and walking with our Blaze Fitbits. We're having so much fun challenging each other, and tracking our progress. For us, this was the best deal ever!!\n \n Judy
Hong Kong;Good
Canada;Captions have all disappeared. Combine that with the non-chronological feed and the images seem random and pointless without description of context. Massive fail.
Canada;The new update doesn't have the seen feature. It suckss ?
Canada;Would like to see a single button on the main screen to push as soon as police are seen, a more detailed description could still remain on the secondary screen. Other than this this is an exceptional driving tool.
United Kingdom;The new update won't update? Weird...
United States;Every time I click on a link, the app will start a pop up saying I've won a free spin. It won't let me read or watch the videos. This is getting annoying. Please fix the problem.
India;Facebook lite*
India;Although its a daily app its a big hassle to download 250 mb apps as an update. Its a great app but the stars also matters \n Pls see that the size is way beyond and my other handsets have a update of almost 400 mbs \n Improve you guys otherwise peoples will not install the app. \n I am on the brink of deleting the app cause of its size.
United Kingdom;K so basically I have a fan page that I wanted to change so when I wrote my bio all it was, was I love Ariana grande and an emoji it just said feedback required so I pressed tell us and said that's all I was putting and it didn't fix it or do anything so then I didn't do anything and I then wanted to change my profile pic to an edit of Ariana grande with a purple back ground and it said the same thing I really need to change it now so plz fix it because this fan page means loaaddsss to me Thankyou Erin
Australia;Makes profile pictures blurry when uploading! Crappy!!
Canada;I have been using this app for a year as a free app and have achieved success: logging, losing and encouraging friends and family who also use the app. Today while I was recording my food entries I noticed an advertisement for McDonalds MCFlurry followed by the banner ad to go premium. I don't know if this is clever marketing to encourage me to disable ads. I imagine the paid articles from Quaker Oats and the like would still continue to appear on the front page. I will still use the app and I will still not pay for it.
South Africa;I love the way you have integrated the security feature about the two phase log in into your application! I am for security and speed in everything l do, thank you very much now l will sleep well, but please as a suggestion make it have a built in password or code to open the messages not as an add on from other developers, thank you.
India;I have iPhone 4... I am unable to enjoy the video call option ... Please provide an update for iPhone 4 too
South Africa;Please enable video download, so that if u have saved ur vids u can download them again and also make privacy settings to restrict others from downloading ur vids or let select vids downloadable!
United Kingdom;I have the paid version of Tom Tom yet I use Waze because it not only tells you routes it does so much more. I just hope I always have waze and it grows strength to strength. My words cannot compliment it enough and Waze is amazing! Maps, route diversions, where traffic is heavy has route diversions, speed. Etc... try it and you will see what I mean.
Australia;Won't load. Freezes. Crashes. Rubbish.
United States;I really dislike how the news feed is now filled with people like other peoples profile pics or statuses. The people they interact with arent close to me so I shouldnt have my facebook filled with irrelevant stuff
Hong Kong;Can't login\n Can't login\n Can't login\n Almost a week ?\n (HTTPS)
Australia;Cmon mark Z surely your billions of $$$ doesn't require u to add video ads inside videos! I just watched a 4 minute video and within 3minutes I watched 2 15 second ads!!! Really???? U get enough advertisements! Leave them out of the videos!
India;Magnificent
Australia;Annoying with all the we found this for you prompting a look through\n \n But good artwork for tattoo ideas
Hong Kong;
Australia;GIVE ME BACK MY NOTIFICATIONS. I'M MISSING IMPORTANT THINGS. \n NO NEW NOTIFICATIONS. JUST MY DAMN NOTIFICATIONS!!
United States;Worst update ever it always crashes especially while watching videos \n \n Return the online list by swiping the right side of screen and remove this stupid useless stories ?
Canada;Works great, love the features!
India;This is rediculous that app required frequent update of more than 200 mb a week.one can not use without update.stupid app
Canada;Very good Socal media app
South Africa;The old version was much better, I mean seriously, why would you take away the like button? Please bring it back, it was fast and convenient, and now I'm sitting with a 1000+ pins on a board I don't even want.
Australia;This app has been ruined by in the last few updates. Stop repeat of posts ffs! Bring back chronological order. Stop repeat of posts ffs! Stop with the ads. Stop repeat of posts ffs! Really...Stop repeat of posts ffs! See how annoying it is?
India;Why does a social messenger app needs 650Mb??? Every other app is trying to reduce file size in new updates and you guys are increasing size in every update, which by the way is every f****** week.
Hong Kong;Force update
United States;Love this app #proudwazer cheers
South Africa;If you're going to discontinue a feature (I'm assuming that is what happened to the Like icon and ALL my likes) please notify users so that they can prepare for it rather than losing information. \n What a frustrating idea to make it just go away!! Please return the Like option!!!
Hong Kong;not user friendly
United Kingdom;Tried updating app. Resetting phone. Haven't been able to follow anybody for the last 5-7 days had serious impact on my Instagram business haven't received any followers for almost a week lost a lot of earning because of this. Can you rectify quickly please Instagram as I won't be using your promotion if this continues.
Canada;I'm able to watch people go Live on Instagram and that's great. As for me, I can't go Live on Instagram because my phone is an iPhone 4s. Would it be possible if u could give that access to Instagram live with older generation phones. Please and thank u.
South Africa;As usual!
Canada;Can't like peoples pictures in comments unless they put a comment in as well
Australia;The new version is always crashing and the videos I play don't have any sound!!!
United States;I have no idea if it's my phone or Instagram .. but it lags and the app gets frozen & wont let me search up people on my followers.
Canada;I hate getting ads every third photo! I don't have Instagram so I can do all my shopping on it! I use it to share and look and pictures for Pete sake!!! Get rid of those sinking ads!!!!
Hong Kong;good
Hong Kong;Fix it!!!!
Hong Kong;.
Hong Kong;√Ø¬º≈í √£‚Ç¨‚Äö
South Africa;Easy and Fun To Use,Pleasant app to communicate with the whole world.
Canada;Great for quick traffic info!
Australia;The whole app isn't loading pages for me. It's not my internet cause all of my other apps work perfectly fine except Facebook.
India;I am loving it
Singapore;Newsfeed will not load at all
Canada;Superbe pour l'√É¬©change d'id√É¬©es !
India;Greatjob√Ø¬ø¬Ω
Hong Kong;√Ø¬º¬Å\n  √Ø¬º¬Å\n  √Ø¬º¬Å\n \n  \n  \n  √Ø¬º¬Å
United Kingdom;Don't hold yourself, post that amazing image straight away!
Australia;√Ø¬ø¬Ω
United Kingdom;Who gave your app permission to automatically increase the volume of my phone whilst using your app? I turn it back down and 20 seconds later it increases it.\n Facebook revenue perhaps???
Singapore;After update of the new version, my fb notification was hang and not update. Its so troublesome till i haf to always rely in my email . Pls kindly fix the issue asap
India;Wow
United Kingdom;Put it back to having most recent as default, not top stories.. I don't really care what happened last week ?
India;After updating to latest version I am not able to access insta, it's almost a week now. Guys need your help
Canada;Il est ou la traduction wtf disparu merci mise a jour de ?
Australia;Thankz for fixed it and now its great to use. Thanks
India;Face filters are not available for iphone 5s even after update....plz do the needed..
United Kingdom;This is my first ever review of a product but I love my new Fitbit HR special edition so much that pretty much straight away it has got me thinking about my lifestyle, eating healthier, drinking far more water than I used too and increased my activity levels. Some more prompts/messages of encouragement randomly would be great especially for those who need it but overall I am over the moon with mines, the technology and quality... Thanks!
United Kingdom;can we get screen resolution support for the 12.9 iPad Pro please? I'd rate this app 5 stars if it was supported. (It's been out for 18 months!!)
India;I have updated the latest version but than also I m not getting the camera facility working on my application which I have seen in many phones by sliding on right side so please look into this matter
United States;Waze is a fast, usually reliable mapping app. I work EMS so fast and efficient is very important to the patients and myself. There are times where it times out or freezes but that is usually due lack of signal.
United States;The new update for iPhone Facebook is not any good. They took away the button on home page to see what friends are online. Now you have to go to the messaging center to see who's online. Also the camera button they added is in a stupid place.
United Kingdom;Really found this app well developed, with a definitely sufficient amount of features! The app is very friendly and gives you encouragement along the way, which is nice as it feels like they're supporting you to your goal. Works great for me (a happy owner of a Fitbit Blaze) Thanks, keep up the great work ??
United Kingdom;Super easy to use and great for inspiration
South Africa;Why did I get billed R29 to update whatsapp?
Hong Kong;√Ø¬º≈í √Ø¬º≈∏
Canada;Easy to use and stay on track. I'm not very tech savvy so this app is simple and perfect.
Hong Kong;7plus
United States;Constantly buggy. Not impressed by any means
Australia;This app used to be great. The current version doesn't sync properly at all. I usually have to log out of the app and close it down and then log in again for it to work. Still doesn't show the distance over the hours when you click on it. NEEDS A SERIOUS UPGRADE TO FIX BUGS!
Canada;Who's idea was it to add Ideas for you to the main view? With no way to get rid of it???\n Stupid. Done with Pin until that is gone.\n Now even more useless changes. The menu bar disappears when off the main feed? How idiotic is that??\n App deleted.\n So, new update April 24. Tried app again. NOTHING fixed. looks like it's good-bye for good.\n Thanks for ruining Pinterest.\n Update, Like a fool I checked out the last update. Still no functionality added. \n I believe it is proof positive that Pinterest does not give a damn about its users or feedback provided.\n Ok. So in fairness I thought, ok, one more try. Still utterly useless, and far less functional than the app was several iterations ago. Moronic.
United States;Easy, and fast app.
South Africa;I used to use the TomTom app but Waze is better in almost every single way. Hasn't let me down so far and hopefully, it never will.
Hong Kong;√Ø¬º≈í
Hong Kong;√Ø¬º≈∏ √Ø¬º≈∏
United Kingdom;Add @luke_bulb (that's not me)
India;After the update I can't to read comments on any pages or posts I can see only stickers only and why should I spend such 200mb update for wasting my time. \n Really mess with this..
Singapore;Newsfeed is full of ads, and will only show popular posts. If u only have a few likes, chances are you are never noticed
United Kingdom;Can't upload photos without it crashing and then freezes my entire phone. Very annoying - get it sorted!!!!!
Australia;Enjoyed reporting in regularly
South Africa;I enjoy the new Whatsapp but could you please bring back the favorites icon, it's hard to get you contacts, nor to reach people you've added on Whatsapp
United States;When can I expect to be able to post a link in my story like so many others I see?
Canada;Trying to add a happy birthday post but every time I add pictures it freezes !!!!!! √Ø¬ø¬Ω
United States;I don't have rewind thing and I'm looking at all my friends use and I'm just like ..... ?f only I had
Canada;U guys are awesome thank you for this app
India;Try to make it clear
United States;Fun to use!
United States;Truly rely on Waze so much! Thank You !!
Australia;Why does Waze only have Always/Never for location permission? While Using needs to be an option.
South Africa;Stop.
South Africa;WhatsApp
Singapore;wanted to type, for my pictures then it hanged , when want to clicked post ,then hangs too
Hong Kong;login √Ø¬º¬Å √Ø¬º¬Å√Ø¬º¬Å√Ø¬º¬Å√Ø¬º¬Å
South Africa;I love my whatapp
South Africa;The best thing ever since google and i mean it. Even google maps can't beat this one √¢Àú¬ù√Ø¬∏¬è great work Waze team ?√Ø¬ø¬Ω
Australia;Why are u making it like snapchat!!!!????? On the dms when you send photos it goes away after a while... the point of group dms is to scroll back up later and see the funny photos!! Totally just ruined the DMS
India;Unable to download pictures and videos on my iphone. Pls fix asap
United States;These text bubble comments are absolutely awful. Can I get the old version back somehow ?
Australia;Cannot update page descriptions through app (also the page app).......keep asking me to try but fail every time.......can you pls rectify ?
Australia;....
Hong Kong;I tried to uninstall and then reinstall the instagram but it still doesn't work. It failed on sending any direct messages or comments.
Hong Kong;Easy to use! Prefect in performance!
South Africa;Good app. Would be great to be able to choose foods from a country.
Australia;So I've used Instagram since 4 years now and what I think would be better is that if we had this online / offline thing so that we could see that is someone ignoring us or not. That's it. Love it.
Singapore;What happened to the chat function that is located at the side bar? And I m not referring to messenger.
Hong Kong;Cant select custom apps like whatsapp etc, totally useless
India;Day by changes are making this app a typical user interface
United States;When you're driving it's very difficult to pull up the hazard features to mark where problems are occurring. I tried 3xs to mark a major road closure and couldn't mark it and apparently neither could anyone else, because hours later the road still wasn't marked. The next day even more roads are closed (flooding) and I'm afraid to trust this app now for my VERY LONG route to work. I already see one problem with the route it's giving me, so I could spend hours driving in circles today.\n NOT how I want to spend my morning.
United Kingdom;Brilliant never fails me on the road
United Kingdom;Despite updates, the app is STILL showing status updates from a week ago. Every day I log on, and instead of seeing latest posts I see random posts from 5/6/7 days ago. There have been updates since but they've failed to fix this - as many users say, you don't say what the update actually involves or improves. Very poor.
Singapore;The more you update the app, the worse it becomes. Now, I cant even read the comments properly because they're too close to the person's profile name and this is not even elderly friendly. What about people that cant see words properly or they are colourblind? Worst update ever.
United States;I enjoy the instagram.thanks for every things
Hong Kong;√Ø¬º≈∏?3 whatsapp
Canada;I used this app for over 3 years now. It's easy to communicate and can see what's going on in our daily life's.
United States;deleted and re-installed, but app won't open on ipad. the icon is unresponsive. (first posted abt 5 days ago and it still doesn't work)
United States;Ever since the latest update, I'm no longer getting any notifications. Bummer dude.
South Africa;Always on point. Always great way to get around
South Africa;Since the new up date WhatsApp has been closing itself mostly when u playing status of friends. This is very annoying. Please fix.
United Kingdom;Newsfeed is all over the place. Why is it showing me posts from 5 days ago followed by a smattering of more recent posts? Even the most recent newsfeed option is rubbish.
South Africa;Facebook app download is not working
United Kingdom;Best social media app! So much more entertaining than any others.
Canada;I don't usually write reviews, but the Waze app has saved me so much driving time, that I felt I needed to give back! It is a great app and I have recommended to many people.
Australia;This piece of Sh√Ç¬°t is cancerous because I'm trying to put up a pp but it won't let me put what I want on it (crop) when I try I keeps on f√É¬ª√É¬ßking up (cropping out me man bun)
Canada;I just updated and it won't let me post videos. Frustrating as I have a good connection but it won't post it.
Canada;I Love all the nice pictures of expert fish tanks!\n I also love meeting new people from all over the world!
United Kingdom;Bought an iphone JUST so i could join the instagram fun! Wish pics weren't quite so narrow because when you want to post ones you've taken on the phones camera, & not thru Instagram, you lose so much of it. Would be nice if it let you reduce it to fit it all in, giving you a black bar top and bottom so I don't have to edit in a separate app first.
India;I've been using this app from last 2 weeks and I'm in love with it already! It is an amazing app for those fitness lovers like me . Not only it tracks the daily step of you but it also make an account of your daily caloric intake. It suggests the exact calorie one should take per day depending on their BMI . For people who wants to lose weight, this is the correct app for you. Don't waste time just kill the install button right away!
United States;I love Instagram!
Hong Kong;
Singapore;Please fix the multiple post option disappearing from my account but accessible when using other account in the same device.
United Kingdom;Love this app sooooo much.
United States;Love how everyone is able to help spot all the traffic and items to watch out for.
India;A longer length of Videos should be allowed or a premium version should be made available
Hong Kong;i can't edit my caption after I posted it \n please fix it
United Kingdom;This has to be the 'go to' app for weight and activity impact when linked to map my run and other more detailed activity apps. I have been inactive for many years and recently due to circumstances decided I needed to not only lose weight but improve my fitness. With the ability to scan food barcodes as ready to go or ingredient based for home cooking it really helps meeting the calorie targets based on weight loss goals and encourages exercise in order to increase your potential calorie intake on a daily basis using net calorie calculations. It's motivating and allows you to set challenges to suit your objectives. I'd recommend to anyone wanting to maintain or lose weight, improve fitness through activity whether walking, running, cycling... whatever when connected to map my run and other apps, don't opt for fad diets, less calories in, more calories out equals weight loss..
Hong Kong;Cool
United Kingdom;It's awesome.
United States;When I get on Pinterest everyday I think about what pins await for me today. I love the app it has all the things I love in it!\n Thank you so much!\n -Unicorn?
United States;Good
United States;the title says it all. everyone hates it. go back.
Singapore;app crashes every time i try to go to a facebook page
United Kingdom;Been using this for a couple of years now and since the chronological posts have been removed it's not nearly as good.
Singapore;Please make it easier to delete multiple media from chats/groups with functions like select all
Hong Kong;√Ø¬ø¬Ω
Hong Kong;After update, can't open.
United States;Better filters
Singapore;The best thing to happen for in vehicle navi !
India;Group video call will be awesome
Australia;I love this app, but I'm not loving the sponsored ads that are appearing after every third or fourth post. Please stop. I'm getting pretty tired of hiding them all. I want to look at images, not ads, thanks.
Australia;Can you stop trying to be snapchat please
Canada;I honestly use this app to much!!!
United States;Great with my phone and my sleep habits tracks all my exercise steps I really love it and I use to use polar watch \n Very happy customer
Singapore;I can't use the app on mobile data after recent update. Only able to reload and gets update while using wifi.
South Africa;Stop trying to be fancy, Ipad version is terrible, slow & extremely slow. Surely FB can do better than this. iPhone version is better, this is really bad!?
Singapore;Most stupid upgrade ever! The camera button is really a waste,bring back the contact button.
India;It's so good
South Africa;Great, clean and simple design.
India;Please, do something about your app. Way too heavy.
United Kingdom;I've updated it and now I just says connecting and will not let me see my messages
United States;Outstanding, that's how I rate this app, one of the best , love it.
Australia;Instead of showing who people follow and their followers in order of relevance or whatever it is in, can we please go back to showing the most recent followers/followings at the top please!!!
Australia;I loved instagram.. But I'm sick of the ads.. Every fourth post is an ad.. If that keeps up.. Im out.. Not happy.
United Kingdom;I have the iPhone 5, and when I go to my status, it is not possible writing in the middle, with the colorful letters, or the emojis! It's really frustrating, since the other iPhones have this feature, and the iPhones are at the same IOS, please fix
Australia;What's wrong with the comments can you even like them anymore \n Stop changing what works
United Kingdom;It good
United Kingdom;Very usefull
India;Good
Australia;Would like to be able to correct traffic conditions i.e. Green for clear traffic when\n previously orange or red. Also thumbs down option for hazards on roadside so previous hazard can be removed i.e. Roadworks or vehicle on roadside. Otherwise it's a brilliant app.
United States;Fix this
Singapore;its fun
South Africa;Love using this app.
United Kingdom;Last update has killed Facebook for me. \n Pointless tweaks, if not broken then don't fix it.\n Stop trying to shove Instagram down our throats and your money making stupid adverts. \n Time to leave
South Africa;Most accurate navi app I have ever used
South Africa;Facebook's updates gets larger and larger - over 200MB more than once a month. Really uses a lot of data for these ever too frequent updates. Please fix this.
United Kingdom;Omg this app is amazing
South Africa;In South African language we say, it's got 'that thing'
Canada;I can no longer send photos to anyone due to a bug it happened after Instagram updated
Canada;Although it's been about one week+, me like!\n \n You can connect, or not. No pressure, like window shopping. It's fun to think of celebs/ stars you hadn't thought of, and find them, as well as old friends and acquaintances.\n \n I'm glad I found instagram!
Hong Kong;Wallpaper \n  Ôºü
Singapore;Legit updateÔøΩ
Singapore;Terrible!!!! I cannot upload photos!!!! It hangs and the app crashes ALL the freaking time! Fix it or I'll delete FB!!!!!
India;Best social media app\n Very useful
South Africa;Almost every video I watch has a pop up ad, this is beyond annoying. I didn't mind them at first but on almost literally every video?! Come on! It's so frikken annoying.
Hong Kong;
Hong Kong;
Hong Kong;No photo show after auto update
Hong Kong;Once update, it crashes with iPhone iOS which fail touch screen response. Keep hanging~
Hong Kong;My new posts can only be seen by me, but my followers can't. Are there any bugs?
Australia;Instagram will not let me download it I have all the megabytes and gigabytes I need but it won't let me down load it someone help me please
Australia;Hands down the best navigation app available. The ETA function reassures my destination exactly what time I'll be arriving and changes to reflect current road conditions. Being able to easily insert other stops into my journey is also very handy and the speedometer alerting me when I drive over the speed limit is a license saver - together with speed camera alerts. All in all an invaluable app!
Canada;Bought a charge 2 and just relized that there's a game on it!!!!!!! Liiiiitttt üêΩüêΩ
Hong Kong;app
Singapore;The emoji button at the side is gone! Pls bring it back
United States;I like this app very much but recently I was very disappointed with the removal of the like button. Sometimes I can't pin something right away because I didn't have a board for it. So I liked it the sorted it out later. Please bring it back.
Canada;This app just gets worse and worse. I don't like the instagram like features in it. That's why I have a separate app for instagram. Makes it all unwieldy and slow. Very frustrating.
United Kingdom;Your details mention how the app uses 61.4mb, but I have to delete and download again at least once or twice a week. If I don't, it can take up to 3GB of space on my phone. Really good app, but sometimes crashes, and turning a bit like Snapchat... please fix the space issues. Other than that, good.
Hong Kong;Can't upload all photo at once, need to do it one by one. Please fix the bugs.
United States;The BEST!
Canada;Soooo... what exactly did you update? Still no contact tab, fav, etc
Singapore;I can't even log out of my account. how can Instagram not have solved such a fundamental issue like this? Seriously? And give us the chronological order back. the format now is not what we want. spend less time giving useless updates face filters and spend more time fixing your problems please SMH
United States;I'm concerned over all the negative reviews. I've only had my Fitbit Alta HR for two days & so far I'm loving it. I'm enjoying the app as well. I'm only tracking my steps, distance, HR & walks/runs.
India;Sync is not working. It was fine the previous day. Pls fix this
Canada;ÔøΩ
Singapore;Can be made better if they took up Google Maps' colour coding of the path to show how heavy the traffic is.
Australia;So many trolls and fake accounts that spam your explore feed. They're desperate for likes and follows and it's annoying as fxck
United Kingdom;I have been using the app for three months, linked to my Garmin devices (calories burnt), for weight loss which has dropped 7kg. Daily calorie targets, ability to scan food bar codes for all the calorie /nutrition info very handy / takes out the guess work. Seeing my calories in/out daily with a weight target keeps me motivated/on target üòÄ\n \n Great app, highly recommended üëç
Hong Kong;
Australia;Don't like the box style for comments \n How do I make bigger I can't read them
United Kingdom;Whats up with the update that doesn't allow you to see the pictures large and scroll down the profile. So inconvenient. The app itself is great but that was a highly frustrating and unnecessary update feature.
Australia;Never skips a beat for me no matter what platform I'm running it on. Loading files and face timing no worries.
United States;This app does exactly what I need it to. Helps me keep a hold on my life and it's easy to track meals, sleep, exercise, and water intake. I have a Charge 2 and I absolutely love it. The reminders to move every hour are helpful for when I'm not feeling motivated. The heart rate is accurate - I've simultaneously gotten my heart rate from my Fitbit and my pulse reader/pulse-ox I use at work - I'm a nurse- and they were only 1 beat in difference. That's a pretty good reading.
India;Crap : 217 mb ??? In the next few days we might need external hard disk to have Facebook app.
Canada;I don't know what is wrong but I can't get the colour status to work on my fully updated iPhone 5s
United Kingdom;I love this app so much! It's such a helpful tool if your a designer or artist! A must need in your life!
Australia;Thanks for ruining society. All people are worried about these days is protesting, rioting and publicity. Thanks for turning the people into opinionated selfish cowards that get off on publishing their boring lives. What a joke. Ruined the world in under 20 years. Facebook is responsible for at least 20% of crimes committed these days. 2% of terrorism. Who knows what else.
Singapore;Overall, Whatsapp is fantastic, it would be great though, if we were able to manipulate the profile pic settings further - pick specific individuals (or create groupings like in Facebook) in our contact list to able to see our profile pictures or to hide our profile pictures from. My current situation is such that I do not save colleagues numbers on my contact list coz I don't want them to see my whatsapp profile pic, solely because it lacks this feature.
Australia;Great and easy way to stay connected with friends especially overseas.
India;Worst
Australia;I can't use instagram bc I use my iPad so I don't have a number so I can't use Instagram so plz get rid of that problem so I can use Instagram!!! That's why I gave it 1 star
United States;Whatever update you've added makes my menu and DMs disappear. Also, I kinda wish my photos showed in order in my newsfeed. I don't see friends posts anymore unless I go to the pages.
South Africa;Insta nva dspnts
India;I'm getting notifications even after logging out! Wtf is this??
United States;zuckerburg wants all the information, and instagram's collection methods are getting downright annoying. this gets worse with each update.
Canada;The Apple Watch version is not working well.
Hong Kong;Can you add back the column of friends online at the right hand side of FB app? This could help us to contact those who are online and increas the use of messenger.
Singapore;Best apps I that ever download highly recommended to all user
Hong Kong;Why such large?
India;It's not performing wel. There is so much of prb .
United Kingdom;Basically in my opinion I think it is pretty good could use in some big fixes and can use filters to piss of snapchat
Hong Kong;Ôºå „ÄÇ Ôºå „ÄÇ
United States;Awesome App
United Kingdom;I can't say enough bad things about this update. The interaction with messenger has gone from bearable to outright awful. And no. I do not EVER want to sell something through bloody Facebook - who wants you in that much of our lives? Not to mention the fact that the feed on the app beats no resemblance to the feed in the browser, STILL, which is just stupid and pointless. I've used this version for a day and now considering deleting it entirely after years of using it. \n \n My only regret is that I can't give you zero stars.
United Kingdom;1. Along with its other apps, is updated every week without any changes - probably just to keep its staff employed.\n \n 2. DO NOT LIKE the view of when, viewing a video and a whole list of other videos you HAVE NOT selected is cued beneath it. GET RID OF THIS.\n \n 3. What is the point of HIDE FROM TIMELINE, when you hide something from timeline after immediately putting it on facebook and 9hrs later, people can still Like?\n \n 4. The size of the app and data/documents is nearing 1GB and is getting out of control and yes, I frequently do a fresh install.\n I think Facebook inc. are trying to take over our devices by buying other apps and then making them so big, that you have to delete other apps to fit them on.\n \n 5. Not all my friends/pages feeds are being displayed on timeline. Only a select few are being shown. FACEBOOK, I have friends and I also have Liked/Following pages, why do you only allow a
Canada;Love your App!! No question, works great. My only thing is that it would be great if you made it Car Play compatible! Please do this!\n \n Chris
Canada;I have found so many useful things on Pinterest, whether it's a cleaning tip, or a great recipe. Love it!
Australia;Love the app, just not loving not seeing posts in chronological order. Kinda look like a stalker liking posts that show up in my feed today, but we're from 5 days ago..
Singapore;Y suddenly cannot download?
Canada;Profile photo is blurry even though it is sized to fit perfectly.
Australia;Started using it in the UK April 2017, now back in Australia I've found it superb, always up to date and accurate.... great app! \n Beats any Satnav I've ever used and google maps!
Australia;Scrolling through is slow and keeps going back to home screen. Also slow when open comments up.
United States;Take back your eating habits with this great app. It will make you think about everything you eat. The results may surprise you. I found in the first few days that I was making a lot of little mistakes that were adding up against me every day. It works and you don't have to diet!
United States;Since the latest update, my app won't even load now, I get the spinning wheel of doom. When it does load, I only get a few stories on my feed before I can't scroll anymore. Trash!
Hong Kong;
India;Mah instagram followers are not increasing üòìüòìüò¢üò¢üò¢plzz help meh in that and give some solution on tht because mah network is also in full speed then to its not working plz increase them ..its seeing in detail bt not in numbers ..\n  Thnk u
Canada;i can't see new posts that i saved! so far it's only one post that isn't in the saved file for some reason but everything else is fine
Australia;Goodness. You Developers should just stop changing things because you can. It was just fine before you broke it. Hate the new updates & sick of constantly having new updates & changes. I have nothing good to say about anything. 0 rating. \n By the way, why take away the seen? Not everyone responds to a post with a comment etc, and it's good to see who has actually seen it. Especially if you are running a business & what to check who's looked at something without having to go through all the Insights etc. \n You Developers should really stop & get off your horses for a while. Go smell the roses. We would love you much better then.
Singapore;Whenever i visit a page on the app it keeps crashing!! Please fix it asap because its so annoying ><
South Africa;Love this app. Use it every single day and it saves me a lot of time!
Singapore;It's an awesome app,works smoothly
United States;This is the best app ever
United States;They latest update keeps failing to load anything into stories. Otherwise everything else is great.
United States;Easy to use, better than Facebook
India;The best thing ever happened to me. Thank you Instagram
Australia;A really great app that helps keep track of my food intake and calories. So far it has been one of the apps that helped me lose weight.
South Africa;My data is on but it just say connecting the whole time it needs to b fixed
South Africa;Hi, please tell me how I can report an Instagram account that run by a fraud. The lady poses as a seller of clothes. After sending her money, she doesn't send the products. \n \n Your reports section did not have an option that I could report this account with. Please inform me how I can carry on with this matter.
United States;The Siri issue has not been addressed whatsoever. I've stopped using Waze altogether. It's simply too annoying to remember the bugs for an app and workaround it every time. Also time estimates are always off making you feel rushed and always behind. \n \n The full voice support is too much and the simple version is too little. The Voice is also more robotic than googles. \n \n Other than watching out for cops on the road I see no use of this app until they address some of these major pain points
United States;New face filters on Instagram today. Nice Job Team!
Canada;Perfect for those who like pictures over text. Have multiple accounts. Advertise. It's all here!
Australia;The Best in the business.
United Kingdom;So awesome
Hong Kong;Ôºà Ôºâ Ôºå Ôºå ÔºÅ
India;So far so good
South Africa;it does what it does
United Kingdom;Since the update I've been getting 4/5 current stories then the rest of my feed is stuff from 4 days ago. Rubbish.
Australia;This app has changed so much. It's the best drivers app by far. Try it. Amazing.
Australia;I get that everyone needs to make money but when I'm 1 minute in to a 3 minute video and it's already been stopped for 2 adds???!! That's just ridiculous. Won't be long and no one will be watching videos on Facebook. You get less adds on free tv!
India;I found Pinterest a very useful app,lots of ideas everywhere.
Singapore;Just like face book but better
Singapore;I have been always replying whatsapp when my phone is locked. Now for some reason, I can't do that anymore. I also cannot find the function to do that in any of the whatsapp settings. Please do something about it.
Canada;It is so addicting. I would üë≤ecommend this app. It is very helpful & interesting!!! #thebestappever
Canada;The app is too laggy especially when searching
Hong Kong;Why?? Fix it as soon as possible!
Singapore;Have been using it for years and I would have to say that the changes made are attracting more users to join the community! Great app! Love the interaction and engagements too! ÔøΩ
India;Awesome app
India;nyccc app
United Kingdom;It's good for posting artsiey things and good for finding memes!
Singapore;Please set a setting to remove swipe left to camera features. Is irritating.
India;Facebook has only backdrops for battery consumption
United States;Where are the comments??? Why I can't see any comments??? Why you are not displaying them??!
Canada;Les sujets sont tous plus int√©ressant et diversifi√©s. Instructif √©labor√© et bien document√©. Merci beaucoup d'√™tre l√†.
Hong Kong;N Ôºå Ôºå N Ôºå
India;All iphone users have mostly faced space prob. So kindly develop option for deleting data storage.
Hong Kong;I need this for work and now it doesn't work at all!
India;Need an option to switch off links loading in inbuilt browser. It's annoying.
Canada;Great GPS. Just a little power hungry
Singapore;Keeps showing old messages that I've read as new ones with the notifications. Pls fix it
United Kingdom;After this latest 'update' it keeps crashing. The camera swipe right is so annoying and unwanted - keep triggering it when scrolling through! No more nearby friends on a swipe left. Seems to crash and give up at least once an hour.
United Kingdom;Just rating 1 star because everyone is complaining so I will too FIX THE STUFF THAT ISNT FIXED FACEBOOK
Hong Kong;Ôºå Ôºü Ôºå „ÄÇ
Singapore;keeps you going through dry spells
Canada;Easy to navigate and helpful
Singapore;So far so good however is there a platform whereby we can share our ideas through pinterest and not just a separate web?
Australia;It's probably my favourite app you should definitely get it
South Africa;It's very nice ...
Hong Kong;..
United States;On the newest iOS, my phone cannot load Instagram. It started to go slow, I did the update and even worse. Can't even use the app now
India;But where has the like button disappeared?
Australia;I've updated the current version. Now it says 'Cannot Refresh -No Connection'. Help.
South Africa;Please bring back the CONTACTS/FAVORITES Tab...
South Africa;Thee best appüüΩ
Singapore;After the WhatsApp update, my WhatsApp chats stuck at connecting even with a working wifi. Tried to redownload but the problem still premise.
Canada;Great way to stay active and compete against friends. Definitely has you up moving around to hit your step goals which is awesome!
South Africa;This is the best app out there currently. Easy to use, fastest route saving you loads of time!
Canada;Who doesn't love a good old IG
India;One and only best social platform to meet people
Hong Kong;Nice
Hong Kong;Keep going~
United States;It has really helped me
Australia;Instagram used to be a great way to share photos with friends. Now it's full of advertising (an ad every 10 pics) and sponsored posts which means my friends photos get lost in the mix and to be honest that's the only reason I use the app.
Australia;My account is constantly being blocked from liking pictures, writing comments, and following users due to 'inappropriate content' in my comment or in my profile.\n Which is ridiculous as I have nothing of that kind in relation to my account and the actions i take on instagram. I usually have to want a over a day before it goes back to normal but then it would happen a few days later.
United Kingdom;The food tracking is good on the app, but the integration with Apple Health to pick up any exercise is a bit hit-and-miss, some workouts being added to MyFitnessPal twice, while others don't get added at all.\n I've ended up just using it as a food/calorie/macro feed into Apple Health.
Singapore;I've gotten used to the ads. Fine. But can we bring back the individual likes? I hate how you've clumped them all together. \n \n Not loving the ads at all! And how I'm constantly being asked to rate it.
Australia;Current version keeps on crashing. What's wrong?
India;Facebook updates are very frequent,\n Guess they should paln their release less frequently
Singapore;I find that when there features are newly introduced in a WhatsApp update, they usually don't work.
United States;Bring back the correct order of when people post, please. Everyone hates the way you've turned Instagram to latergram by putting posts at the top of someone's feed from a week or more ago. Big mistake by you guys. Bring back the original Instagram please.
Australia;My newsfeed is full of ads!! Ridiculous, it's bad enough Facebook decides to show me specific posts from specific friends (instead of all my friends posts) now my feed is FULL OF ADS. Makes me not want to get on Facebook.
Hong Kong;Can I have the 'Favorites' tap back and 'recall' feature?
South Africa;Can't drive without Waze on any given day.
United Kingdom;Whatsapp has got progressively worse with each update. The storage structure of the software is poor. It's states you have more usage than you actually do so clogs up your phone.
Canada;Why would u get rid of zooming in the chat when sending pics to your friends u didn't even warn us u said It was a bug fix please just fix
Australia;First you take away the button to see who's online. Then you bring it back 2 weeks ago. Now it's gone again. WHY. Keep it there. Plus tooooooo many useless updates, using up all of my storage
Singapore;Updated so many times, but still do not have the new filter function. All my friends have it already! :(
Hong Kong;Merecedor de 4 estrelas, s√≥ n√£o ganha 5 por causa das propagandas in√∫teis.
Canada;Super unstable and always crashes, I've had this problem for months. Just please someone fix this
United States;Great way to share experiences with friends and family!
Hong Kong;Failed to load news feed. Only a little dot shown on the screen. Please fix
Australia;I cant access the market place icon on this app :/ what's going on ?
Australia;Used to be great, but since changing to a non-chronological format and an ad every 4 or posts, it's gone to the dogs. \n I would happily pay for a premium version that meant no ads and chronological. Lift your game Instagram or I'm off to jump on the Ello train!
United Kingdom;Instagram is a lovely way to talk to your friends and is safe and amazeballs
South Africa;Best app and m loving it like poetry
Canada;Helps in counting nutritional facts and logs ur workout, water intake gives a comprehensive summary for ur daily goals aiding ur journey to ur personal targets! I've already shared this app with friends and loved ones after seeing it make a huge impact on my own routine along with others within my circle of trust... download this and watch how much easier it is to make ur life simpler!
United Kingdom;MyFitnessPal, is now a practised part of my day. I've lost nearly 2 stone since January, I'm not rushing. This app has helped enormously and helping to teach me all I need to able to maintain my weight loss once at target.
Australia;Anyone can do it, but maybe not everyone should.
Canada;Links are constantly reloading. Can't read anything. Very frustrating.
United States;ads ads ads ads ads.....and more ads
South Africa;App works great and easy to use.
Hong Kong;Can't see many post after update, many post is blank even sponsored post.
United Kingdom;No fr. Really?
United States;I can't comment on my live or anyone else's !! Please fix
Australia;This app actually makes better drivers simply because anyone who uses this app instantaneously becomes more aware of not only their own driving but others as well.
Australia;Every second post in my feed is an advert. DONT UPDATE!!\n \n And stop telling me to follow people- if I wanted to I already would!!\n \n Your app is on the slide
United States;It's great gives me best ideas
United Kingdom;Very useful apps for Facebook.
Australia;Please add language Arabic\n Too Facebook\n Please add language arabica\n Please add language Arabic\n Too Facebook\n Please add language arabica\n Please add language Arabic\n Too Facebook\n Please add language arabica\n Please add language Arabic\n Too Facebook\n Please add language arabica
Australia;An incredible app to help measure your intake
Australia;Great but...when I click onto saved posts it doesn't let me make a collection/album. Also...the irrelevant ads are showing up on my feed all the time....
Australia;I woke up this morning and scrolled through Insta and suddenly there are ads every 5 posts I scroll through! What is going on!? If it keeps up like this I'm going to delete the app, it's not worth it.
United Kingdom;it's so easy and fun to use. really helped me with my instagram. Awesome just all I have to say go more likes
Canada;Everything went fine till I loaded last version 2.17.21, it dies not connect to the WhatsApp system and it says that I don't have internet connection.\n Way to go Facebook, you have to put your stinky nose at this fine working app, bleeeeh Facebook
Hong Kong;My Instagram version is up to date but I found out I can't really unblock users cause their Instagram accounts showing user not found, is there any way to solve this problem?
United Kingdom;This and the Fitbit blaze have changed my days completely, can't recommend it enough!
Singapore;The sensor to show the clock sometimes doesn't work effectively when i turn my wrist. Furthermore, whenever I have to see the time i NEED to flick my wrist every time just to see the time. It doesn't allow me to see the time at different angles without having me to flick my wrist. I find this really annoying. Even if i do flick my wrist, in only works 90% of the time.
Australia;I like being able to interact with people all over the world with a single touch. I use it to keep people informed about any events I run and to keep up to date with readings on healings, yoga, sound... articles relating to my work as a teaching yoga therapist are always of interest. Sadha Siva to all...
Hong Kong;Ôºå Ôºå ÔºÅ
Singapore;As we all know, Samsung has this option to instantly reply WhatsApp without opening the app itself. Apple should do that too as it can get quite inconvenient to open and close multiple times when there is a message.
Australia;I love this app and I spend hours on it and one thing I liked was the 'like' button, I preferred having the like tab than a like board. The reason I 'like' things is because they aren't fit for a board so they fit in the like section...
Singapore;Please check on the function. I can't upload my IG story. Once I press upload, the app crush. Kindly please take a look at it. On and off I will have this issue.
Canada;Fix the problem with signing in on 2 accounts!! Let alone now we need Facebook in order to sign in? Horrible almost ready to delete this app for good
United Kingdom;Use it regularly
United Kingdom;Won't let me comment on people's photos and keeps saying error tap to try again
Canada;I find the app works great and is such a wonderful way to connect with like minded people!
Canada;Best driver companion, with one very annoying bug, when start app in landscape mode it stays in portrait until I remove the phone from the holder, twist to portrait then back to landscape again.
United Kingdom;ads, ads, ads.
Canada;I don't like the new update that you can't see the description or who it is from, do not like the circle things. I wish they would not change something that was working well.
Hong Kong;If multiple photos are posted at the same time, all are blurred with no reason!!
United Kingdom;Can't see who has posted pins now so I can't tell if it's content my friends have posted or advertising. Also stop forcing me to install your app when using a browser. Seriously fed up with the changes you've made, now unusable
United Kingdom;Have logged food diary for two weeks and have lost 5lbs - after months of no luck! Would recommend!
United States;Love this app that syncs with my mom's old flex. Perfect for the newcomer and I LOVE the sleep feature! Think I'm sold and will definitely be a repeat client.
Canada;Love my new Fitbit Alta and the app!! So helpful and wonderful!!
Singapore;When you select multiple photos, the photo size is automatically square. Is there a way to retain the full size photo when selecting multiple photos?
United Kingdom;Lovepretty cool Functional, cool and easy to use! Really works and helps small businesses to get more likes, and internet traffic! this This is the best app which increases the number of free instagram followers with some decent ways to achieve ‚Ä¶.
South Africa;Brilliant app. I use it instead of Google Maps now.
Hong Kong;ÔºÅ ÔºÅ\n  Ôºü
United States;I swear to God, please bring the Likes button back!
India;The Instagram is one of a kind. It is truly an aspiring app. But for a few days my news feed isn't updating as in it is not supporting my network . Please see to it that this bug is fixed . Apart from this love using your app
Canada;Avoided many tickets using this app.
India;Posts are not opening. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app but problem continues. Please fix it.
India;Excellent feature to group multiple pics and swipe right on a msg to reply !!!
Hong Kong;ÔøΩ
Canada;Charge HR, iPhone 7 with latest iOS and app version. Device correctly synced to the app, but whenever I attempt to track exercise with the app, it freezes up.
Hong Kong;Caption and comments Unable to post in current version all tags were gone
South Africa;I love using instagram as my personal blog. What you see on my page reflects my life ÔøΩ
India;Love this app. Provide lot of data in a categorical way.
Hong Kong;post Ôºåpost Ôºå
United Kingdom;Why can't you click onto profile pictures?
Hong Kong;
Hong Kong;Can't @ my friends on others post & why the post is not link up to Facebook page after transfer to business account? \n Pls fix these problems ASAP.\n \n Post many photos in one post, can't review the photos size.
Hong Kong;Pls fix it asap..too bad
Hong Kong;ÔºÅ
Singapore;As per title, after the latest update, couldnt sync my fitbit device and was constantly shown that my fitbit device battery is empty despite full charge and using it everyday.
Singapore;RM600Ôºõ700Ôºâ
Australia;The latest updates removing the ability to see who pinned something to your feed are garbage. No app has ever been improved by removing functionality.
Canada;It's a good app, I can get lots of stolen memes on it, but too many repetitive ads for bad mobile games.
Canada;This is an awesome app
Australia;Had to delete and reinstall app several times as it crashes and doesn't always show who is online.
Canada;I can't view my online friends on messenger by swiping left from the original Facebook app. Terrible update losing tabs and functions.
United Kingdom;Recently I've been struggling to see pictures on this app. \n I love the app, it helps me a lot, work wise etc. But without the pictures it's no use to me.\n \n Edited: I still don't get pictures. Getting disappointed now.
United Kingdom;Just updated Facebook but keeps crashing sporadically...never had an issue before. On iOS 10.2.3.
India;Unable to search messages :(
United Kingdom;I don't like new update ÔøΩ
South Africa;Best best
United States;I love this app. My only suggestion is that the next up date includes Apple Watch compatibility. It would be nice to be notified on the watch as well as the phone
United States;Hate this app
Singapore;Please fix...
Hong Kong;instagram app Ôºü ÔøΩ
United States;Where did the heart option go?!?!?!?!?! ÔøΩ
Australia;Ever since the update my news feed has been stuck. The same two posts with the refresh and scrolling features not working. Please fix
Australia;I accidentally deleted this app but when i reinstalled it and logged in, Instagram had unfollowed a bunch of people that i know. I had to explain that I did not intentionally follow them. This situation has cause many misunderstanding. Thanks Instagram.
United Kingdom;Cannot upload more than one photo at a time to an album. When multiple are selected, the app just freezes.
South Africa;Best navigation app by far
Australia;Videos on Facebook continue in a loop and don't stop unless you force close it???\n \n Running iOS 10.3.1
United States;Love love love
Singapore;The notifications haven't been refreshing for a few days now
United Kingdom;There are no words to describe. Just say waze has given me the freedom to drive again without the stress of traffic....
Canada;Great social media app...
India;Fast fast application install problem
United States;Kind of amazing how intuitive this app an be. Keeping a star only because of occasional bad instructions (that don't cause loss of time or get me lost or anything, just confusing like in 1 mile exit to Cool St. but I'm already on Cool St. Even more rarely it takes me around traffic that actually would have been faster to stay in. Minor issues. Great app overall:)
South Africa;Anti-Traffic App.\n Reliable
United Kingdom;Does exactly what it's supposed to and does it well
Canada;Message bubble at top is gone so I don't see when I have messages from people any longer!  Please fix asap!
United Kingdom;Again and again!! Why??
Australia;The camera app is very irritating, does anyone actually use it? \nGetting to most recent is a pain and should be easily accessible. \nEditing or deleting a comment is now a challenge.
United Kingdom;It's the best app ever and whoever doesn't have it I would definitely recommend it to them because it keeps you in touch with all your family and friends. It is the best texting app ever.
Canada;New update is horrible.  Doesn't have the messenger icon???  Stop updating, you keep making it worse
Hong Kong;Sometimes I create new post, I wrote everything and already posted, but the post didn't show up the words! Is nothing in my post
Singapore;best messaging service EVER!!!
Australia;Sick to death of it forever changing. If it ain't broke. Don't fix it.
Australia;Hopeless
United Kingdom;Would be great if you could move your images on your profile around so they are seen in another order instead of only according to date posted. With people able to press a button to view in date order instead maybe.
Singapore;Good apps
Singapore;App is good. But if we have Touch ID lock it will be very useful and more secure.
India;Not getting any kind of notifications badge in the app icon for any kind of update . I have to open the app to see how many notifications are there.\n\niPhone 7\niOS 10.3.2
United Kingdom;Fantastic app .proud I have it. It had saved me lots of money from buying sat Nav. So accurate.still loving it.
South Africa;Love using your app. It's a well rounded app. One suggestion thou, being able to assign custom profile pictures to contacts. People put crap up and I just want a face to remember who it is. Not some pictures of their dog?keep up the good work ÔøΩ
India;When useing it was just getting closed
Singapore;I'm always happy with whatsapp till this auto optimising of chat and thereafter it deleted all my previous chat, photos and videos. Leaving me with only the current month memories. Pls assist to solve this.
Hong Kong;Really need to put some work into this. The button is so close to clear message button, with no confirmation whatsoever. I've recently quit a group twice. Make it a button on the top right corner after entering group info or whatever to avoid disaster please! URGENT!
Australia;Generally pretty pleased BUT there is a missing link with some ingredients such as himalayan salt - there are a number of trace minerals & elements found in himalayan salt such as potassium etc but only lists sodium in the breakdown! Many scanned ingredients i've added doesn't list main ingredients that are fairly obvious ones! Also, it would be great to have all ingredients, minerals etc generate through to iPhone Health Data like iodine and the many that don't get picked up.\n\nOverall .... it's a good tool to support specific dietary consumption!
Hong Kong;ÔøΩ
India;The regular updates make the the app very smooth and fast.
Australia;But it's as simple as, there are streets right in the Adelaide CBD that don't exist in Waze. But do exist in google maps.
Singapore;Minor improvements to perfection so work on it instagram , you're getting there.
United States;I'm not really liking the current version as much as I have some of the older ones.
United States;I RARELY leave reviews, but lately Instagram has sucked. First, bring back posts in real time. I miss out on a lot of posts from users I follow simply because Instagram has decided to filter posts based on what they think I want to see or posts that have the most likes. I don't care! I want to see the posts of people I follow as they happen and not 10 hours later ... Secondly, what the heck happened to being able to upload a video?! I can't upload a video without my screen going blank and then the app crashes. Fix this!! Really frustrating and seems like Instagram is becoming more and more like Facebook everyday. No thanks.
Canada;I find that this app has very poor shortcut and guidance routes in rush hour. i think its algorithm tries to avoid straightforward routes to avoid backups however not only are its route congested, they are also slower than google maps directions. for over a month i logged my usage with waze vs google maps and in the end i give the nod to the latter as its routes are more straight forward and also overall faster. This app was a total torture in the month that i used it, never got stuck in such bad congestion before. For example in toronto Don Valley Parkway (freeway) gets very congested during rush hour and instead this app recommends taking more city streets, however this ends up being even worst as the city is always backed up due to redlights, heavy pedestrian presence and public transport. it's much better sticking with google maps (online with traffic) less complicated directions. The only
Australia;Why was messsenger removed from the Facebook app.\n\nDon't change something that isn't broken.
South Africa;Really like it, although sometimes subscribed things disappear
Canada;SUPPORT IT
India;Good one app
Hong Kong;Great App\nEvery use\nHobbies galore\n\nNeed more vintage leather
Australia;So many versions are released, cant you guys fix bugs in one go and release a stable version.
Australia;I love my app for Facebook on my iPhone.
United Kingdom;Makes photo's both old and new look great! Fab for sharing- I think we all prefer to share our lives in pictures!
Australia;My Alta HR won't sync
Canada;Although there's a few features that aren't on all devices this app is perfect. Has helped so much
South Africa;This version is terrible. I can't even record a voice note, I'm not recommending this app to ANYONE. Fix it.
South Africa;Can you please add a feature where you delete the statuses from your iPhone, cause they take up a lot of space when they get save on your phone. Please fix .
Singapore;Nice
India;nice then every thing new story mode rocks
United Kingdom;Worse service of update
Canada;We lovethe premise but the new updates make it crash every time we try to post videos \nThat a side we love the mass communication ability \nWish I could stop myself from being tagged though
South Africa;Best traffic app with up to date info
Hong Kong;What's wrong with the photos displaying sequence AGAIN? The same photo keep sitting on the top of my feed.
India;Best app to connect someone
Hong Kong;iphone   Ôºü
Canada;It keeps track of everything in one place, you can even sync it with other apps.
United States;Love this app
United Kingdom;Yep
India;Unable to login through my Facebook account from yesterday
Canada;It would be wonderful if there was something in a new update where one of your friends posted in 10 different buy and sell groups if they could be merged into one notification instead of 10. Would be greatly appreciated!
United States;Love the app
Hong Kong;
India;not working properly, hangs s lot
Canada;I like the app and everything works good. But certain interfaces are good, some aren't. Why does it keep changing?
Australia;It is a fabulous way to keep on track. Very user friendly.
India;Latest updates have made the app really laggy and even makes there app hang sometimes. Especially the new grouped videos feature. Please fix this asap devs.
Hong Kong;after panning right in the feed page!  friend request shown BUT fail to pan right and go back
Hong Kong;I am not here for seeing all those ads which appears after 3-4 posts non stop. This makes me want to quite ig.
United States;I love Pinterest, it has pins for any topic you can think of.
Australia;All good
United Kingdom;Hardly use Facebook. 50% of my battery. That's background even when refresh is turned off! Awful app. Now sticking to browser app as I can use messages without having to install yet another app!
United Kingdom;I love this app but the updates make it worse -EVERYTIME please bring back the like shortcut
United Kingdom;This App is awesome and much better than other available navigation Apps. Also it's a good fun to update events and editing maps. Nothing better than this for free navigation with fast events update.
Canada;Great app, it gives me all I want!
Canada;I love Facebook and I hope it's keeps on getting better
United States;The information highway! Things I can wrap my life around
Singapore;I dont have the face icon for face filters on my iphone7. My ios is the most updated. Ive reinstalled instagram and it's the same.
Singapore;hi, i love using insta however today my ig KEEPS crashing! please fix this!!
Australia;? ADORE THIS APP?
Australia;Videos keep freezing. I think it's the new mid-play ads? \n\nRegardless, my whole phone freezes for a few minutes each time. If you're going to try to monetise your video feed, at least have a system which can support it. Videos take ages to load as it is, then you try to add more?
United Kingdom;This has helped in so many ways, showing how many calories I need to help me lose weight to easily being able keep track of what I was eating
United States;It keep force closing
Australia;I love the memes and stuff u can put on from 1000 walpapers amazing keep it up ÔøΩ
Australia;Yes, I really love it.\nGood for traffic & cops.
Hong Kong;reactions  „ÄÇ
Hong Kong;ÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ\n ÔºÅ\n tick Ôºå Ôºå  „ÄÇ
Hong Kong;
United Kingdom;Can't you do anything original or do you have to just do what Snapchat does?
Singapore;Best navigation that I downloaded! Can use it in offline mode ÔøΩ
Canada;I wrote regarding an issue and the response that came was a standard answer to an FAQ that did not address my specific issue. I need a phone number and contact of a live agent that I can speak to.
Canada;Crashed repeatedly so I uninstalled now it won't let me reinstall
Hong Kong;CAnt use
India;There is something seriously wrong with the app. The photo quality of the uploaded is very poor.\nThere is a drastic difference in the photos that get saved after uploading and the one which is on display.\nThis is not done.\nThe purpose off the app is gone.\nI would like u to look up to this issue and fix it as soon as possible.\nInstead of copying featuresfrom other   social sites it would be better to focus on your primary job.
India;Why the package is too big?
South Africa;Cool app
South Africa;I honestly used to love instagram! Not so much lately. It has a promblem and does not allow me to log into my account from my device. I have tried on other people's devices and it works. My account is even verified and everything. Instagram has let me down. I actually have to use a web browser to access my account now and this doesn't have all the features like dm and etc. instagram let me down big time ÔøΩ
India;this current update having connection issues. Also could not able to download videos
Australia;Prefer the desktop version, but this will do. It's efficient enough, can't complain. X
United States;I wish I could rate this as -5 starts because it's so terrible that nothing is chronological. If Instagram doesn't change this back then I may stop using the app. It's annoying because I miss so many posts. This is the worst update yet. I am livid.
South Africa;Instagram is a awesome app but I think it should not be so complicated for unfollow users on Instagram it should be simple & there should be not time limit to unfollow users
South Africa;Esikhophasi
United States;Love it! Was hooked from day one!
United Kingdom;Love this app and all the new features but unfortunately it won't let me access the face filters on my phone I've updated and it's still not working?
Hong Kong;Im ios user.  After updated this app, i can only notified how many comments or likes by others, but can not show the contents and updates from it. Pls fix it asap, this is very annoying
Singapore;I use alot of navigation apps . This beats all and is very updated
South Africa;Dope
Hong Kong;Fix the bug pls
Hong Kong;fbÔøΩ
India;One of my favourite apps.
Australia;Its good but would be nicer if can update cover photo and if i could turn my cell on the side and the fb app adjusts to that.\n\nAlso, the app is glitching like it use to be. I'm trying to scroll through my newsfeed and it keeps jumping up whenever I stop scrolling. Please sort it out guys. It hasn't been a problem since a few updates ago but now with the recent update its doing the same as before.
South Africa;We hate the new version - where is my contacts list????? Bring it BACK PLEASE!!!!!!!!
United Kingdom;Love it loads ÔøΩ
Australia;Please tell me how to turn it off or fix it if it's a bug the notifications I am getting events near me- I don't care and I'm not alone, one of the forums has at least dozens of app users getting the same issue. Please fix ASAP!!
Australia;Every day I had a challenge to recreate and learn different styles of photography. Thanks for the creat experience.
Australia;This is a tool that has really helped me with weight loss, super convenient and I love the barcode option now.
Australia;I could deal with editing the timeline algorithm. \nBut now my photos I've archived to post later, is gone. What the hell insta.
Australia;Very good good product - the feedback from users about road conditions is terrific. Response from the map edit team outstanding
Canada;I love Facebook more then I should. I can talk with anyone find pages and just have fun. I found one of my sisters on Facebook who was missing.  It honestly i love it. I wish that it'd be more updated on the iPhone but yeah:). But can you please fix the chat? I miss having the chat heads it was so much easier to talk to people with.\nChat heads were awesome and all my friends and I agree they should be brought back!
South Africa;Good
Hong Kong;Ôºü
Hong Kong;Update  Ôºå
Singapore;Please fix the connectivity issues as whatsApp is essential. I tried using data and wifi but still unable to connect, Please fix it asap. Thanks

Canada;Depuis la derni√®re mise √† jour , je n'ai plus d'ic√¥ne qui me permet de voir quand j'ai re√ßu des messages sur messenger. Dommage car certains messages sont obsol√®tes quand j'en prends connaissance. Peut-on esp√©rer que √ßa se r√®gle bient√¥t.\nMerci
South Africa;AWESOME!!!!!
Canada;When will Ontario Canada get face filters? Follow @toxic_strike
United Kingdom;Keeping track of what I eat used to be hard, not anymore
India;Many bugs have now been fixed. Stability of app is very good. Just one thing that is required is some visual changes. For long the app has same graphics so please give some new graphics.....
Australia;could use with event related road closure info.
India;Whatsapp has to add hide features for secure chat
United Kingdom;Great satnav app
Hong Kong;Update  Ôºå Ôºü
United Kingdom;Great for avoiding traffic if you just believe what it tells you.
Australia;So handy to know what road to take in the event of an accident.
India;App crashes every time user click on notifications..fix this soon
United States;Great app
Canada;Love it :) best photo journal
Australia;Fun, but add being able to remove people from group chats. We added someone and they started spamming so we all had to leave. Please add that. Thanks insta
Singapore;Tried redownloading and still won't open
Hong Kong;Why keep seeing old posts in news feed?
Singapore;i kept refreshing and it always failed to do so .
Canada;Excellent app from the fine folks in Israel. Original design then bought by google. Way to go! Use it everyday.
Hong Kong;I can't see all of the comments after updating,WTF? Please fix it!
Canada;I like that when I chart foods I can have the app tell me what vitamins I am getting and where to improve my diet. Then when I exercise more I feel deserving of treating myself while controlling my weight goals.
India;?ÔøΩ
United States;It was great before the adds! I am contemplating deleting the app because of it. Every three pictures and I see an ad. Even hiding the ads doesn't work.\nUPDATE: Now every time there is a video it automatically plays the audio, so when I'm in public I have to turn my volume all the way down because I don't want everyone to here the videos that I don't even want to here the volume to. I am seriously considering deleting this app, I am getting so frustrated with it and I can even contact anyone from instagram because there is no contact information! If you are not invested in instagram, don't download it! You'll regret it
United Kingdom;Images do not load!
United Kingdom;This is definitely one of my favorite apps and I would reccomend it! It's easy and fun to use and a great way to communicate with friends!
Canada;Gros irritant, les vid√©os devraient se lancer sur demande pas sur affichage.
United Kingdom;was pretty decent, but recent updates have been overall unnecessary and have actually made the app worse. not a fan of the randomised timeline, too many ads where there used to be none, and the app keeps crashing. Updates to the DM system have also been useless and added nothing to the app, update for the sake of an update
United Kingdom;What is going on latest update has stopped my WhatsApp from operating!! It keeps saying connecting and no internet connection where has the favourite tab gone too it's so annoying please fix
Singapore;Lol so yah I just think maybe if you could consider like adding a feature that can enable or toggle the layout of the feed that'd be damn coool :))))
India;It's not working
Australia;I love the app and how easy it is to use. Watching all of my relatives trying to use the story function was hilarious tbh. I just have 1 problem, and that is that when I turn on timeline review. It only works for certain people and not on others. I'd really like to control what goes on my timeline better without having to delete something so please fix this!
United States;I Love It!!!
Canada;Always crashing every time i scroll down then boom it kicks me out of the app. Ever since I updated this dame app. . FIX THE DAME APP!!!!
United Kingdom;Privacy concern
United Kingdom;So updated my Facebook app as recommended on my iPhone 7 plus and now the app wont even open..... been using the Facebook app for years why keep changing something that works now i cant get on Facebook at all unless i go though safari.........feeling really annoyed now
United States;I love this app to get me around traffic when regular GPS just can't do it.
India;Is there any bug ? Suddenly from the main screen it will go to Friend list and there is no option to go back on the main screen.
South Africa;Connects people everywhere! Love it
United Kingdom;Since latest update posted links no longer open in app. Do a better job, facebook!
United States;Driving frequently to different locations and various times of the day Waze has been a valued partner in getting me and my clients were we need to be in a timely manner. I have learned to trust it when it suggests a change in route and rely on it for arrival times.
Canada;Went from a 4 Stars to one star.  \n\nNothing is in chronological order anymore! Don't like to see posts  from 20 hours ago first.  Who from instagram thought it was a good idea??\n\nWhy I'm I getting notifications for the same post hours apart.  ?
Singapore;Instagram copies Snapchat
United States;9out of 10
United Kingdom;Why !?!? Over a GB of memory used for this app in a couple of days !!!! It's a PHONE/TABLET app !! It shouldn't be so consuming!! Stop over complicating an app that was better 2 years ago than it is now !!!! Not impressed !!!
Singapore;why others got colors with pattern design, iphone user dont have. Updates are all suppose to be same right???
Singapore;The button for voice recording is at the right corner which is difficult when holding it to record a message. Sometimes it stops recording just because my finger shifted 1mm. \nRelocate the record button in the middle and bigger in size probably will help with this issue. Just an advice. I'm always happy with WhatsApp no matter what. It's my go to app for many many years!
India;All are good , we can talk, chat everything is ok but please improve some security system \nEg: anyone can read our chats , it should  be secure via some passcode system like BBM has...
South Africa;Every time I send a voicenote it ends at 9 seconds then I have to send lots of voicenotes after one-another to finish what I wanted to say.\nPlease bring back favorites and contacts!
United Kingdom;I don't know what's happening. In the morning I can easily access my Instagram account, everything's fine. But in the afternoon my page won't refresh and the app is basically dead! It's not my internet because I can access all my other social media accounts. What's going on?
Hong Kong;The caption of photos cannot be shown after posting the photo.
United Kingdom;Fantastic App that links to fitness trackers too.
United States;Most coolest app I could ever have???
Hong Kong;.. .. .. android whatsapp..iOS  .. 200 ..
South Africa;N√£o criticas,mas gostaria que um dia melhorassem e dissessem ao inv√©s de vai virar daqui a 100 metros dissessem vai virar a 100 metros na rua (e o nome da rua),tamb√©m seria bom
United States;Can't drive or ride within it. have used it in MD, FL, NY, NJ, DE, ME and PR. There have been issues at the beach and overcast days.
United States;Sincerely it's a great app that always help me to find the best way to get anywhere I go. Congratulations to the great team to make it good and better every day
Hong Kong;Updated the latest version but it doesnt have the new Archive photos function even i restart/ reinstall the App. My friend who also using iphone already has it. Such inconsistency among users create bad experience for us.
United States;In my opinion it is the best social media app I've ever used
Australia;Hi! I really love this app however, a while ago i blocked someone and now cannot unblock them. The only way i can access their profile is through the blocked list and it says user not found. I really want to unblock her and i know she doesnt have me blocked. Could you guys fix this? Thanks
United Kingdom;Hi,its a very good app, but it should be better if it can show the road,or junction better,I mean, when you have more lines,is not showing in which lane you should stay,etc.\nZoom could be better as well but overal I really like it.
Hong Kong;ÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ\n1. Ôºå ÔºÅ ÔºÅ\n2. ÔºÅ ÔºÅ ÔºÅ\n3. 40 ÔºÅ ÔºÅ
India;Unable to download videos on wifi and story not downloaded while story download it shows error msg...
Australia;I swear the updates are getting worse and worse every time. Put the messenger button back down the bottom, get rid of Stories (no one uses them - snapchat exists for this!!!) and PLEASE bring back the chat sidebar/active friends list!!
Canada;Certain comments on posts do not show up and it's becoming a big problem. Please fix immediately.
United States;It honestly makes absolutely no sense whatsoever that there's isn't an option for in use when it comes to the location services. Why have location on always if the only time I need it on is when I'm in the app navigating? I don't know about everyone else who rated but honestly always location on drains my battery to the point where I notice a MAJOR difference when it's on and off and I have to go to settings and change it every time I use the app. Please add the option it should have been there since the beginning of the app.
United States;When you lurkin an you accidentally like a pic from long af can't be doin that\nTake it away from me\nGotta actually the tap heart to like because we be gettin in trouble
United Kingdom;What can I say? It's awesome! It helps me share my special moments with the world and connect with wonderful\npeople everywhere. The editing features are great - I even use it to improve pictures that I don't share on IG. Sharing on Facebook and Twitter is built in. And it's free! Five stars and a BIG thank you Instagram! I love you!
Australia;Not too bad.
India;?ÔøΩ
South Africa;Excellent ??ÔøΩ
Singapore;WhatsApp like not working cause when I video call my friend and my friend can't hear properly
India;Very convenient to use
United States;It's much easier to train yourself to watch what you eat when you know how many calories things have, I eat way healthier now.
Hong Kong;Cannot see any feed after update! Pls improve as soon as possible!
United States;I used the like button all the time, for assorted things I wanted to review again. Now A LOT of things are simply gone. \nTherefore, dropping it from 5 to 2 stars. Sorry not sorry.
United States;Updated to new version but now I can't like anyone's photos. Why?!?!
United States;Used waze for years! Love it and won't drive without it. Lately hasn't been as accurate... still LOVE
India;When i try to download face book the error will sow me temporarily unavailable \nPlz solve my problem
South Africa;Anytime I need a idea, a remedy or advice on something my answer is Pintrest. CAUTION! It may get addictive.
Australia;Bring back the option where you could see how long ago your favourites were active
South Africa;Great service and amazing app
Canada;If you drive in a city you need this app. Do yourself a favor and start using Waze.\nThis app also helps me avoid hwy traffic jams in the country heading to and back from the cottage by finding alternative routes. If you are not using Waze yet and are using your phone as a GPS you are being foolish.
India;Current video shows a screenshot from the previous video. Lot of bugs in this build. Please fix.
Canada;I have a weird glitch that when people like it, it doesn't show up. In my notifications it says 2 people's names -1
United Kingdom;The app is now over 200mb! Making it impossible download outwith wifi! The app was best when it was a simple streamlined version of the website... and around 30/40mb... too many bells and whistles had to ruin an otherwise straight forward app.... now runs very slow, glitches and crashes regularly, especially on slightly older devices.... had to delete it so many times recently that I won't bother with it again the future... will still the website from now on and enjoy Instagram instead on the phone... you spoiled it FB! You could have just kept it simple... all these dancing stickers etc just makes seem like it's for kids now. ?
Canada;Like the interface. The Instagram apps are difficult use.
Hong Kong;Ôºå 1 ÔºÅ\n ?
Australia;Why are the updates becoming so big, I would understand if we weren't updating for a couple of months but lately they are 200-300mb and today's is 366mb.
United States;Thank you for the opportunity to live in the moment
Hong Kong;Please fix it!
United Kingdom;Why can I not change my privacy? Every time I attempt to change it hangs on saving!
Canada;Incompatibilit√© avec Messenger, tr√®s difficile d'acc√©der √† mon Messenger je l'ouvre et il se referme tout de suite...  vous m'avez sabot√© un de mes 2 groupes et fait perdre de l'argent en me chargeant pour mon groupe...  Je perds r√©guli√®rement des amis sur mon compte facebook/Messenger et je dois refaire une demande d'amiti√©...  est-ce assez comme cela car je peux CONTINUER...
Australia;I'd rather this than Facebook
South Africa;Great for dodging traffic
United Kingdom;Excellent.
Australia;Thanks for listening to my feedback about the size of the reduced running videos. Is there a way to keep where you're at on your newsfeed? It's hard to keep track of where you're up to and actually read through your entire newsfeed when it keeps popping back up to the top and refreshing. \n\nIs it just me or is the app still crashing?
United Kingdom;Been using for a week now and has highlighted every traffic camera and police car. More users on this the better for me and other users of the app. Download it now people ÔøΩ
India;I totally love Pinterest! It has changed my way of writing.
Hong Kong;it freezes so often on my iphone, and guarantee it freezes when i hit on the other person's dialogue bubble trying to use the copy/reply function.
United States;Update removed ability to immediately see who pinned something and to which board, which was one of the most useful things to see. With that gone the app now is cumbersome and annoying to curate boards and a good group of people to follow. Additionally, it seems at least half of what shows up in the home feed are poor suggestions based on my now-irrelevant past searches or paid advertising spam. Pinterest is making itself annoying and useless with every change.
Australia;New Facebook app notifications now gives me notifications that aren't necessary, or not updated, or worst, no notifications at all! Like seriously worst feed application design ever!
Singapore;I posted a picture with captions and it wasn't a problem before. But i reviewed the photo and realized there wasn't any captions, even after i reposted the photos, try to edit the caption, it just shows error saving changes. ? and please change back the non chronological posts things
India;Good app
Singapore;- i like facebook but needs to improve more\nSuggestions:\nCan write something to individual images even if they are uploaded in a group - done\n- possible to select different font style and font size? \n- can bold the letters?\n\nGoodluck! More power!
Hong Kong;Please advise where can I make the complaint that you Facebook  always block my right to leave messages during others' live broadcasting without any concrete & sound reasons! This is the second time! I feel so discontent about it! Can your head office manage this problem seriously! So bad!!!
United Kingdom;I have loved Pinterest for a few years now. Recently there was an update where you could click humour and get every pin under humour and scroll for eternity. The new update however has changed the humour section to group certain types together. There doesn't seem to be an all humour section anymore. They did so well and then ruined it by going to far. I now hate Pinterest and rarely use it
Singapore;Very user-friendly app. Very comprehensive. Good and easy to understand displays and readings.
South Africa;Absolutely best app! Communication has never been easier!
India;Awesome app
Singapore;Awesome Favourite app for posting beautiful pics! Great app that's easy to use! Thank you for creating this!
Hong Kong;No in app notifications, need to click into the app to receive the msg
Singapore;Good. Would be better if alternative routes are shown. Routes are not always the fastest route.
Hong Kong;the update is just for the ad post.\nrubbish
United States;I'm aware of the food I get every day

Australia;I can't get the volume button to work on rewind...ÔøΩ
Singapore;Ok ok la
Canada;I always have to delete and reinstall the app because it can use up to 2Gb of storage

Hong Kong;postÔºå ÔºÅ
South Africa;??ÔøΩ
United Kingdom;Improved.
Canada;Instagram, why? I have a normal running phone but when it comes to the notifactions lord, do I have something to say. THEY ARE DELAYED. When I get a notification from one of my favourite idols, I think it's a new photo for video they are posting but NOPE, they actually posted that specific photo HOURS ago. For example, I get a notification saying that Danisnotonfire just posted a photo! I click on the notification only to check the time stamp that he actually posted the photo two hours ago. INSTAGRAM FIX THIS!!
Canada;Missing the old Pinterest. \nWhy in the name of all that is good and holy did you get rid of the like button?
Hong Kong;After upgrade Facebook, its worse than before, cannot review Album n still upload photo in one batches (40photos), pls fix it urgently.
Canada;You are already making piles of money from our personal info - leave us alone!!
Australia;Instagram is really good because you can share posts witge your friends and it lests you connect to old ones. I LOVE Instagram and use it all the time?highly recommended itÔøΩ
South Africa;On it 24/7 and even have a page for my Great DaneÔøΩ
United States;Instagram is my fav app on my phone it made me more closer with my friends and I'm happy so I love instagram...?
United Kingdom;Top class
United Kingdom;For the last few days I have been unable to load up Pinterest on either my phone or iPad. Have deleted the app and re-installed it but sadly nothing on either. All was working fine a few days ago and now I can't get on to my most favourite and constantly used app ?.. not sure how I make it work but assume a fail in last update?   Different colour boxes appear but no photos load up???  Gutted.  Please rectify this issue Pinterest as I'm missing being able to access it ÔøΩ

South Africa;I love the app but don't like it that people can check if I am online or not.
United Kingdom;I really do love Pinterest and is a really bad addiction for me but the past few updates makes finding pins relating to my boards much harder such as when you clicked a image you used to could view all the other boards where that pic would be saved on I mean the 'saved to 24 boards' sort of thing and that used to be so useful and made it so much easier to find boards to follow and pins but now that's removed it's really annoying I wish you could bring that back in your next update.\n\nI don't like the notifications either like I find it hard to follow who's pinned my pins and who is following me and which boards but I don't mind that really but I did prefer how it used to be. \n\nAnother thing also I don't know if it's a glitch or something but when I follow board and people and if I wanted to look back at their boards or profile I obviously go on my profile and click who I'm following and what bo
United States;The app use to be so user friendly, now it's not as enjoyable because it's trying to compete any and everyone!
United States;I absolutely love it! Been a subscriber for years!
United Kingdom;ÿπÿßŸÑŸäÿ≥
United Kingdom;I can't see my notifications, (only when they appear on my screen, I go to look and its showing me notifications from 2 days ago?)it's slow and freezes. Even when updated! I just want to be able to nose and post nice things! ?
Australia;Love it's usability and ability to connect the creative community.
Hong Kong;No longer be able to see board list which saved the pin. Bad version!
India;I am losing the feel of using whatsapp.. do remove that status thing which was copied from snapchat.
Hong Kong;app\nRubbish
United Kingdom;I love Facebook especially the app...\nIt provides a sense of safety, security and comfort whilst travelling anywhere alone...\nIt is a tool and is perfect to stay up to date with multiple friends at once. I think the impact Facebook has had on the world is extremely positive. Allowing people to network across the world and stay in touch with people Internationally is incredible! Exchanging details with people we pass by and communicating, sharing snippets of our lives and thoughts with each other along the journey of life is wonderful. The benefits of having the application on the mobile far outweigh the negatives! \n\nI believe Facebook has strengthened family bonds globally, giving people the opportunity to share experiences with others is a lovely feeling! Especially for busy entrepreneurs, it encourages family members and friends to show we care even when we are extremely busy! \n\nA* app - Tip
India;Everything was good and suddenly Unable to download images since morning having tough time \n Receiving some important msgs from work \n Pls update ASAP
United States;It has a very good food calorie data base with a nice social network.
United Kingdom;This is the only messaging app that won't let you view your contacts, unless you go into start writing a message to them! It's a messaging app, but you can't directly access your contacts, absolutely bonkers!
Australia;Great app
United States;Love the app!!! Could tell you when to make a turn a little sooner. Says my house is four doors south from where it actually is, but good thing I know where I live.
South Africa;Couldn't do without it
United Kingdom;App likes to crash, 3 times today, hardly crashed that much a week till the most recent update (11.6.17)\n Bit annoying when you're 8months down your time line looking for an old post üôÑüò©üò°
United States;This has some of the greatest ideas the world has to offer.
United Kingdom;I live instagram... \n \n A little to much üòÇüòÇüòÖüòÖ
India;üüΩ
Hong Kong;Reli got too much advert
South Africa;Great place to store memories
South Africa;1) \n Occasionally in a chat it will suddenly go to a previous message instead of displaying the last message in that chat. \n \n Example: while typing a message or doing anything in a chat, suddenly it will show a previous message in the chat instead of showing the last message that was sent. \n \n 2) \n There is still a problem with Voice Notes getting cancelled while recording. \n \n Example: while recording a VN suddenly after a few seconds it gets cancelled automatically and then an incomplete VN is sent. \n \n 3)\n With regards to improvement it would be nice to hide status updates completely without still seeing a blurred out picture of the status. \n \n Looking forward to the new edit/retract feature!
United States;Wish messenger was still in the Facebook app and not a separate one
United Kingdom;Such a slow system which often needs to be closed and reloaded.
South Africa;Really on top of it! Active reports. Accurate at least 95% of the time!
United Kingdom;A good way of communicating with your friends and family and is also good for arranging things overall an amazing social media
India;After i updated my what's app yesterday the chats contact are double

South Africa;Great app and essential to have!
India;Great
Hong Kong;just like it!
Singapore;Why cant people hear me when i talk? So damn annoying i swear! zzzzz
Australia;Current versions of the app have an over-the-top amount of advertising, which is a real shame.
United States;Very helpful
Canada;You should hire me to improve user friendly status. I was very good at this because l treat every user has just grade 3 education, while your programming guys treat the users the same level of education as them or Mark, the boss, and many things you have to think before you can use. This is just not on if you want bigger users of facebook.
United Kingdom;Since the last update I have to keep signing myself back in and have to constantly put in my password in the settings on my phone. Same with the messenger app. Annoying!!
Australia;Works incredibly well!! It's fast and reliable and it allows you to do all the things you could on a computer.
Singapore;Unable to link post to fb after the update.
Hong Kong;Ôºå
Canada;It is what it is and it's good at that.
Australia;Much less involved than other social media, I love it.
Australia;Instagram is meant to function via hashtags. Then they shadowban you and they don't work. \n Refuse to acknowledge the issue. Refuse to explain why or how.
South Africa;Instagram is a really kool platform to share pictures whether of yourself or just beautiful works of art . thank you .
United Kingdom;Beat social media platform
Singapore;Unable to mass upload photos. So frustrating
United States;Nice, easy app to keep track of calories for weight management and weight loss.
India;Cannot sign in. The sign in page is flashing and keeps saying authorisation failed  when I don't even touch the screen
United Kingdom;Simply brilliant. So accurate with its time estimations and the routing has been faultless.
Australia;Random reloads in the middle of reading something and regular crashes. Very hard to use.
United Kingdom;Just gets worse and worse not like your do anything about it but hey ho, unable to play games such as draw something because of Facebook, also a major floor in my eyes I will click LOG OUT go to sign back in and it DOESNT even ask me to enter my password!! Same with deleting the app re installing it yet it DOESNT ask me for it which I think it pretty bad!! Also why the hell am I seeing posts from last week and not from today! Talk about annoying Sort it out
United Kingdom;Says I have a notification. Doesn't show up what it is since the most recent app update today.

Australia;The tiny X to remove Pages You Might Like that you don't like or have already liked is so difficult to hit sometimes.... needs a Remove like Friends You Might Know.\n \n And so sick of Top Comments - should be away to show ALL COMMENTS CHRONOLOGICALLY BY DEFAULT!!!!!
Singapore;WhatsApp is the most used app in my iPhone. I find that this app does messaging right. Best part it's free not to worry about messaging limit. :)
United Kingdom;I love this app it never lets me down ! I would be lost without it
United Kingdom;An instant insight into the everyday lives of other people. It lets you create a great looking photo, not just a quick snap with the ordinary camera. It's not just pictures of people's food.

Australia;Wonderful App BUT doessn't work with iOS4.3.5
Singapore;There seems to be a number to indicate there's notification but when I enter the app, there's no new Likes or Comments for my posts at all
South Africa;New version is terrible. It does not pull data from Apple Health app anymore. It always use to pull data from Apple Health app which was fed by the apple watch. No way to compare calories in vs calories out. I thought updates are meant to make the app better?
United States;My account got hacked and they won't do anything about it...not even deactivate it. Tons of kids follow me and now there is nude pictures and crap!
Canada;.
Canada;Terrible design. Can't see any new friend requests and I hate how messages are now a tiny button at the upper right corner. Liked it better when all the tabs were the bottom.

United Kingdom;Facebook messenger is pointless why have messages on Facebook when you can't open them without this pointless messenger app why it's rubbish :( \n \n Mark Zuckerberg likes our money but doesn't like dealing with complaints there is no contact number for dealing with complaints and no replies to you complaints by email so Facebook is more like Wastebook
Australia;Yes , lot of interesting üç≤ photos in HD in all aspects, üòä. Love ‚ù§Ô∏è ly.
Singapore;Crashes EVERYTIME I open a page.
South Africa;Great app! Really very good. Highly suggest it.
South Africa;It's great
South Africa;The amount of data being deducted from viewing a video is too much. Reduce your data intake on videos or at least indicate that the person updated a video so that we don't view it if we don't have enough data. \n Please work on that\n \n Also PLEASE BRING BACK OUR FAVORITES
Canada;Luv it ü†°!
Australia;Works as well as expected
Australia;No customer support. No protection against harassment. Inundated with dodgy China ads. Where is all the ad revenue going greedy zuck? Not employing customer service. Shame on this sick 'philanthropist'

United Kingdom;You seriously need to remove the swipe right for camera function!!! Sick n tired of trying to scroll and getting the poxy camera!!! If I want to take a pic I will use my camera not a bloody app!!!!!
United States;I think this app is magnificent. the only issue is the new update Instagram Stories. it happens to be EXACTLY like snapchat. it's a bit much. but overall, this app is a great way to spread fun and cheer for all who are near!
Singapore;This is a must have navigation app for all drivers and riders
United Kingdom;Best there is
South Africa;Lost everything
Hong Kong;Since my friends' and my whatsapp stopped at 18-5-2017 around HKtime 1:30-49am, the time of last seen doesn't show the same as the message time.
India;Please fix an annoying bug on Iphone 7 . Whenever I try to Direct Message someone photos , it sends 2 photos instead of one.
United States;Very detailed, great for skirting traffic
Canada;In my opinion #1 app, crucial app....\n Would pay a fee if I had to!
Hong Kong;wifi Ôºå ÔºÅÔºÅ
United States;The latest update is completely useless. I can't even get on Facebook as soon as I get on the app it crashes. I've tried deleting and redownloading and it still crashes as soon as I log in.
Hong Kong;apps app, delete downloadÔºå download
India;For the past few days I am having problems downloading images and videos sent to me.
Canada;Best app for real time traffic by far. Only 4 stars because the maps quality aren't great compared to others and Google maps provides better views of alternative routes while driving with eta estimates. \n \n Still is my favourite navigation app.
Hong Kong;So much bugs after update, even unable to load the picture
Hong Kong;iOSÔºå9.3.2 Ôºå app Ôºå

Hong Kong;app...
Canada;Works extremely well with my FitBit and great to track food
United States;I love it!!! I find everything that I'm looking for.
Canada;What are those terrifying new buttons at the top of the interface for??? New functionalities with no explanation whatsoever
United Kingdom;^ Is the nicest way to say it! It's overall not bad but i keep getting an annoying hour of it saying connecting... and won't connect whether you have full bars of wifi or 4G! Kinda driving me crazy..
Australia;AMAZING
Canada;Really handy and easy to use.
Canada;PLEASE make it possible to preplan meals I use another app for this. What is the point of logging food after you've eaten?? Or only planning for one day. I love planning my weeks and shopping accordingly, to me this is a HUGE flaw, would love to use the app for cal intake/burned but I don't have time to enter food Everyday I would rather do it once for the week! Love the rest of the app!!!
Australia;Love this app, Pinterest is full of great ideas and pictures, so helpful!!

Canada;All a mutual follow feature to see if the person follows you back would be a gereat feature!
United States;I can't upload a video from my camera roll to IG stories without it crashing literally every time. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the app several times, and restarting my phone. Nothing works, it keeps crashing. I can't add any videos to my stories and it's getting super frustrating.
India;Really useful and helpful. Thanks instaa
United Kingdom;It's good
Hong Kong;
Singapore;Stop making redundant updates please.. bring back the chronological timeline
United Kingdom;Difficult to understand. Took me a long time to work out how to use it and still not sure I've mastered it.
United Kingdom;Goood
South Africa;These ads in the videos that we are forced to watch and can't skip are totally ridiculous!
Australia;I use ios 8 on iphone 6 but i didn't get face filter
United States;No puedo enviar chats, la aplicaci√≥n se congela y desaparece el bot√≥n de enviar. Desinstal√© y volv√≠ a instalar y se sigue colgando la aplicaci√≥n cada cierto tiempo y los chats no se env√≠an. La √∫nica app que no funciona en mi tel√©fono es WhatsApp
Hong Kong;I choose recipients and though the msg send to them separately, and then it forms a group chat??? That is totally stupid !!!! And so lucky I choose only two people. Please fix this user-unfriendly problem !!!!!
India;I dnt know wat facbook update is for ....... N y d updates r so frequent ..... N i dnt knw y the size of the update is so high ...., can any body reply me for this
United Kingdom;Got rid of the app and just use Safari. So much better, no real difference (unless you're an addict) and it's freed up so much data on my phone.
United States;Desde hace 4 meses he escrito a Instagram para que me resuelvan mi problema con las publicidades , ya que las misma se aprueban y no son visibles a p√∫blico... y hasta ahora no recibo respuesta no soluci√≥n a mi problema , siendo empresa necesito utilizar el servicio de publicidad de manera √≥ptima.
South Africa;Cant send or receive any messages but all my other social media apps are working ?
United Kingdom;The timeline is all over the place, if you come out of the app it jumps back to the top so you have to scroll back to where you were and I am now unable to follow people!!
Singapore;Why does ios facebook app have such slow loading when you first start it up after so updates stating speed improvements. Now i get network error when i am still connected to a fast 4g network with full signal strength. Your app is getting worse not better!
United Kingdom;This is a fab app works great with my fit bit helps me keep track on things easy to set up and use love it
South Africa;Ease of use and connectivity with likeminded individuals. Awesome app!!!
Australia;Awesome product. Finds routes around tolls that Apple and google can't.
South Africa;I cannot find my contact list. I want to view people's profile pictures without actually going into their profile. Mark make a plan. Bring back the favorite list. Please. Not much to ask for
United States;instagram should have a night mode just like twitter
United States;Don't like that the Like option is gone but I absolutely HATE that you can't see who is pinning or even what board they're pinning to now. The feed looks like an utter mess now and I don't even want to scroll through it anymore. Such a shame how downhill these updates have sent this once great app.
Australia;I LOVE instagram. My fav form of social media.
Australia;Great
United Kingdom;Amazing
Canada;The app is okay but it takes up way too much space, especially with the updates.
United Kingdom;Fantastic I use what's app personally & for business
United Kingdom;Good fun, easy and simple way to express through photo.
United Kingdom;Detail the changes because I want to know what you have changed and all that
Hong Kong;Ôºå
United Kingdom;Uninstalled as it attempted to update buy itself and couldn't. Won't be bothering again. I'll go back to my paid fb apps
India;Useful for all people
Canada;When I am being good and use the app consistently, it's great! The reminders help and keep me focused.
India;It was fun to be on Insta always
United States;amazing, truly. the fidget spinner videos are the best thing yet about Instagram! my eyes glow up whenever I see a fidget spinner suddenly pop up in my feed, truly, honestly, just seeing them make me the happiest person alive. my life was so dull before, but now that fidget spinners have come out it makes me happy that Instagram shares that GREAT content videos. I do recommend this app to all you fidget spinny loving people. :)
United Kingdom;Every fourth post an ad and the posts are no longer in timeline order. Deleted
United Kingdom;As an older (and much slower) user of Instagram I would appreciate a downloadable instruction manual of all the controls and definitions from Instagram so I can use this otherwise excellent tool to the full. Also a big pain is when I try to edit my profile, if I delete any text the keyboard pops up and covers it so I have to guess where to end.
South Africa;An absolute essential app for city commuting.
India;Do us a favour and just close the f app doesn't work anyway
United States;Creative routing around traffic problems. Uses your speed and reported problems to detect backups and generate workarounds if available. So keep those reports coming Wazers if you're not driving that is! \n \n Drawback is the battery drain thus removing one star.
Australia;Instagram is great except for some old people like me. I wish all the functions were also available on my desktop. I find that very frustrating.
United States;98% of the time Waze provides the best route. No digital devise can compete with the street knowledge of taxi drivers, or the realities of street lay outs in suburban developments.
United States;For the past week I am not able to log into my account i have a business and personal account it is not allowing me to login it's also not telling me that my password is wrong so I know that's not the problem I also cannot log in with the log in link that you send to my email
United Kingdom;Very slow. Often doesn't even open. Not consistent with news feeds etc. Bad app.
Canada;I have a iPod so I don't have a phone number and it keeps asking me for one when I don't have one help
Canada;App does not work with existing numbers. If I put in a new number it works. Tried his, then tried to change my number from the new to my existing and it does not accept my existing phone number. It's almost as if the existing numbers were all stripped from the whatsapp database
United Kingdom;Enables you to track most calories for products effectively , not spot on with certain items but decent for the most part
Canada;Awesome!
Australia;At the end of the day I like to upload my stats to Instagram. I've saved my metrics so it's in KMs instead of miles. On the app it's all good but when I upload it displays miles. Could this be fixed please? Thanks Fitbit team
India;This is by far the best app. The only thing i want is you should add place for cover picture on the profile like on facebook. Please..!
Hong Kong;app
Singapore;Crashes every time I try to go to a page
Australia;Some (most) of the photos in the newsfeed don't load. In their place a refresh icon is displayed. Clicking this icon doesn't fix the issue. Seems to have only started happening with the latest update.
United Kingdom;So I took the Facebook app off my phone ages ago when I read it was killing battery life. I use safari instead. I just went to try it again and it's 233MB. A few months ago it was 160MB! For an iPhone app that's basically a glorified browser? Facebook, fire your app devs and hire people that know how to code for iOS, which is probably the most prevalent platform your customers use. Come on guys, you're supposed to be one of the worlds leading tech companies. Time to start acting like one.
South Africa;Great navigation app. I especially love the option to predict my trip time in advance and navigating around traffic. I find it to be about 80% accurate.
Singapore;There a issue on backing up
Canada;Why am i seeing posts from 3hrs then the next one is 9min ago it should be from recent to oldest. Awful. \n \n Does anyone read this from instagram or do you guys just get fake accounts to add 5 stars
Singapore;Stickers not showing. Strokes malfunction
Singapore;- every update takes 300+ MB\n - should at least let the user know before changing any feature - for example, they remove interest list without notifying the users. All of my interest lists was gone just like that when they won't even let me have the time to backup.\n - messenger icon on the top is just ridiculous.
South Africa;[More ranting]
Singapore;Too many ads! Please just remove it or minimise it. I only want content that i have follow . Please thank you
United Kingdom;I hate satnavs but I love Waze. So easy to have accompanying me on my journeys. Update info and changes on route when required. The voices and commands are excellent and never confusing. The screen view also is spot on.
United Kingdom;After 5 mints showing network error unable to load newsfeed or anything els this problem facing from last 10 days
United States;Instagram would be better if you knew how many people view your pictures
United States;I despise this time jump, like an MTV video.
United Kingdom;Such a great platform, easy to navigate and really simple to use. Old additive, if it works don't Chang if. Always there at anytime.
Hong Kong;Please follow up\n After updated, the Facebook does not show any newsfeed or stories.\n Please fix, thank you
United Kingdom;won't let me post a video
United Kingdom;You can no longer share photo memories from your on the day memories. Please sort this out.
United Kingdom;Better interface then FB \n \n however both insta and fb has one downfall which being able to select and delete multiple amount of people. or deleting conversations. \n please add this thank you.
India;I phone
United States;Great app and brings people together! Ignore the trolls! Great updates.
United Kingdom;Hate the new whatsapp for the simple fact you can't just view someone's profile without calling them and cancelling the call I don't like the changes that have been made in that sense honestly dislike the status change also whatsapp needs to change again
United States;I really enjoy this app. I use it daily. I also have the paid version but there is one issue I noticed. When you log your food for let's say breakfast, it used too show total macros for each meal but now it doesn't. I'm unsure if this feature is still available but I'm just doing something wrong or if it was taken out all together.
United Kingdom;Its a dank apppppp baby girl
Singapore;After the update, I stopped receiving notifications. Please fix this.
Canada;Fameux
Hong Kong;‚Äú ‚Äù\n  WeChat Ôºå send
India;The app size is 250 mb, then why the hell it turns to over 1.2 gb within a week!! I am fed up!
Canada;Best traffic app ever!!!!
Canada;Every time I watch a video, it takes about 30-60sec for the back button to work. It freezes and stays stuck on the end of the video. Fix this please... it's been a few weeks now!
Canada;The search field doesn't show mutual connections first, it just lists out the most random Instagram users. So frustrating trying to search for a company! Only noticed this after a recent update.
Canada;Love this Pinterest very informative and very clear on how to get to things.\n If you have friends let them know it is very easy to get onto Pinterest.\n So good.
United States;I Facebooke a lot. The apps fine, but I wish it had all the same functionality as the desktop version (which I NEVER use unless I want to review security stuff). I wish it integrated with my other apps better... often when I have the option to sign on with Facebook it doesn't actually work. All in all it's simultaneously a good app, yet its Facebook, I guess I hold them to higher standards.
India;keep it up
Canada;Love Instagram. You should be given the option whether you want ppl to see who you've followed and what photos you've liked. I like Instagram more but my fb still loads the fastest. When you close out your feed should stay exactly where you left off when you return.\n Instagram is the best app accept twitter allows you to post what you want without deleting someone's account if they post R rated stuff.
Singapore;It would be good if there is an option to backup all video / photo to iPhone iCloud Enable / disable .\n 2. The storage media had a setting to expiry such as weekly / monthly so it auto delete housekeep to keep photo / video low .
India;Great app. Unable to view Member profile. \n No photos in comments possible- major negative.\n Can see all posts at one spot - a major welcome aspect.\n All the best.
Canada;Tr√®s fonctionnelle et tr√®s pr√©cis \n Il ne faut pas sans passer
India;Sign up errors since 3-4 days.
India;App is good.but make a redesign or makeover in UI.pls its a request\n Please bring applock in ios.can u?
Australia;No way to turn off 'Stories' completely. \n \n And app updates always toggle setting of use less data to off mode.
United Kingdom;Yes and also add an option to accept and decline group invitations. Only then you will get more stars or even five stars.
Singapore;Suggestion : add dark mode ?ÔøΩ
United Kingdom;I used to love this app, but the recent have updates mean watching and closing videos is now a 2 step process rather than the 1 it used to be. Very annoying! Also the full screen & X buttons seem to need multiple presses to get them to work. I hope these issues are resolved soon so I can give this app the 5 stars it usually deserves.
Canada;No bad review ever from me.
United Kingdom;Helps me when bored brilliant app
India;Good
Singapore;My dms keep lagging and it says that I have new messages but they're just old ones that I'd seen earlier??? Fix this
Canada;Yup
Canada;Je n'appr√©cie pas du tout le design pour les commentaires et les r√©glages. J'aimais mieux comment c'√©tait avant, maintenant, c'est moins clair. Je trouve aussi qu'il y a trop souvent de mises √† jour, il faut se r√©adapter √† chaque fois. \n \n Merci de lire nos commentaires.
Australia;Please give us an option to leave group chats without members knowing- since you got added without being asked anyway!
India;Best app ever for pics as always love thisss!!!!
India;Not able to download any images after update \n Please look into this
Canada;Since the last 2 updates my push notifications stopped working
India;Awesome
India;370 mb update for facebook are you kidding me.more heavy then a high end game its discusting.stop it
Australia;Very good
Australia;Massive food database in calories or kilojoules, syncs with loads of fitness devices logging takes only a couple of minutes a day, an awesome forum community which debunks the many myths of the diet industry. I cannot thank My Fitness Pal enough.
Canada;I use it every day and I am sometimes surprised at the most efficient route, but it seems to work!
United Kingdom;Latest update is a joke, when trying to close the irritating suggested pages the whole app just now closes, what a waste of time, do you never test updates?
Singapore;Awesome App
Hong Kong;Pls fix
South Africa;I can't believe that this app is free. It is really fantastic and has helped so many people I know lose weight. It has every product found on the shelves.
Hong Kong;Huge data base whicg easy for me to keep track on my diet, i hope they can expand the excerise data base too
South Africa;Great app and very user friendly..
Hong Kong;Cannot upload videos, cannot download pics, cannot pause when the video running, not really friendly for using
Australia;Excellent app for tracking food every day. The only thing that could be improved is the ability to change from calories to kilojoules.
United States;This is a great app. It has helped to increase my awareness of the calories and nutrition I consume as well as a very good logging of calorie expenditure. Thank you
United States;Meh.?√Ø¬∏¬è
United States;New update is crashing on iPad, fix it. If I press Sales Groups, it crashes.
United States;Oh for crying out loud enable LANDSCAPE!!!!! This is just stupid.
United States;Was working perfectly well till I did the update 2 days ago. Had problem logging in information into the app and different aspects wouldn't sync. Now unable to log into the app after uninstalling and reinstalling it, keep getting error message. Hope Fitbit fixes this soon.
United States;I've been using my Fitbit alta since christmas, love it, love the app, But I would also like to see improvements in the food department. \n \n Could you please make a better search for common foods? They don't always show up, instead I get a bunch of generic brands I don't really eat. \n \n And I would love to see that you guys could create a recipe log. A place where you add ingredients to know how much your homemade mango smoothie actual nutrition info is. And the ability to store it.\n \n Also, a sugar% please! A way to track sugar would be awesome. Please please please
United States;Just getting started but liking my fit bit so far
United States;Strongly reccomend for boosting your ecommerce with more Sales and engaged clients
United States;I get see what my friends are up now
United States;Awesome place to express your ideas
United States;its awesome
United States;A darkmode would make this already great survice even better so please implement a darkmode!!
United States;So cool
United States;I love this app--especially for recipes. Also great for game ideas with the kids, fundraising ideas, decor, fashion...life!!
United States;I used the like button often and now that it's gone it's frustrating when I don't know what board a pin should go but I also can't save it. Also all the pins I had liked are just gone! I think it was more useful to some users than what you thought.
United States;I find it pretty easy to use.
United States;Why did you remove this feature? I use it to flip phone onto seat so it turns off display saving on battery. Please add it again.
United States;Why would you allow the ads to cover 1/2 of the screen? Why would you allow the ad to remain there for so long? Do you really think it's safe for me to X out of the ad while driving? My directions are typed in before I drive so why would I touch my screen to remove an ad? Why doesn't the voice tell me the name of the street before I get there? It currently tells me just as I am on the street making it impossible to turn. Why doesn't this app tell my which side of the street my destination is on? Take a page out of google apps' book and fix this app. It used to be great! It can be again!
United States;Works great
United States;Great app. Needs compatibility with the Apple watch. Then it will be perfect.
United States;Love this app. Granddaughter traveling in Europe this summer and we're able to communicate and enjoy some of the sites she's serinf.
United States;Keep the platform clean, don't try to copy stupid social media trends. \n \n Why I want to see people story that I just added their info in my contacts for business, I don't want or see anything about your life. \n \n Keep the app clean, I will always give it 5 stars because its ad free. \n But don't try to make it like snapchat.
United States;I love it!!
United States;√ô‚Ä¶√ô‚Ä¶√ò¬™√ò¬ß√ò¬≤
United States;Il est oncin
United States;I must say this app with its dynamic info generated by the users has not let me down during why travels. And with every update it gets better
United States;It has a very good food calorie data base with a nice social network.
Canada;J'utilise quotidiennement une application pour les routes pour m'indiquer principalement les bouchons et les autres chemins que je peux emprunter. Waze Est bien mais avec quelques bugs. Il est tres convivial, ce qui est apprÃ©ciable mais pas aussi fiable que son principal concurrent (et parent, en plus)
Australia;Had charge hr but it broke , charge 2 has better display but disappointed with silent alarm and notifications , heaps better on hr
